Goes great with garlic bread.</p><p>For me there is no better spaghetti sauce that the stuff I grew up with.
Period. I grew up on this stuff and maybe that&rsquo;s got something to do with
it, but when I make my friends have no problem polishing off a plateful
and coming back for more.</p><p>My dad learned his first version of this recipe while working in an Italian
restaurant in college. He made it a bunch of times while studying at
Berkeley because, besides tasting great, it can be made in big batches
and it refrigerates well (up to about 2 weeks).
Over the last 30 years he&rsquo;s tried a lot of different things before arriving
at the recipe I present to you. I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I looked forward
to eating this when my dad made it when I was a kid.
