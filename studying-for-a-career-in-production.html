Producers vary widely in their areas of expertise from: former artists to programmers to testers to business people. My boss is a senior producer who used to be in marketing. My executive producer used to manage a business software product line. Another producer I&rsquo;ve met has an MBA from Harvard. Neil Young shared some tips with me on what makes a good producer <a href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html>here</a>.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Koz&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
