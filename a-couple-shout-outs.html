Good to hear from you Tara S.! I&rsquo;m looking forward to grabbing a beer and swapping notes on the industry as soon as we find a chance. And thank you to <a href=http://profile.typepad.com/gamegirladvance>Jane</a> of <a href=http://www.gamegirladvance.com/>Game Girl Advance</a>, who deserves pretty much all the credit for me meeting all of these people&ndash;after <a href=http://www.gamegirladvance.com/2003/11/direct-marketing.html>her post</a> on GGA I can really see the word getting out!</p><p><em>Updated on June 8th, 2015</em></p><p>Abbreviated Tara&rsquo;s name at her request.</p><p><em>Updated on October 6th, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
