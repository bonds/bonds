<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>I had my first interview with EA today. John Vifian gave me a call at the <a href=/and-on-the-eap-front.html>appointed time</a> and we talked about the job of Development Director (DD) at EA Partners (EAP). It was fun talking to him&ndash;he has some great experience in the industry.</p><p><strong>Development Director</strong></p><p>The DDs report to Exec Producers who report to Tom Frisina. As I understand it, DDs at EAP represent the publishers (EA&rsquo;s) interests on a project by helping guide the studio EA has a partnership with; ideally to help them take a successful game and turn it into a successful franchise. That involves the omnipresent budget, schedule, and product/quality <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1556159005/ref=sib_vae_pg_4/104-7998853-1870303?%5Fencoding=UTF8&keywords=triangle&p=S045&twc=8&checkSum=liEp6n4LqpAGxqgPYRnlD61L72TBrBNPnW1T5JKzZmo%3D#reader-link">balancing act</a> for which the DD is ultimately responsible. It sounds a lot like a publisher-side Producer role as I&rsquo;ve seen them at other publishers. The DD at Maxis is a bit heavier on the technical side of things and is internal to the studio, so EAPs DD seems a little different. I think I recall John mentioning that the role is somewhat new for EAP, but I&rsquo;m not certain if I remember that correctly.</p><p>We also spoke about my reasons for wanting to work in game production and whether EAP would be a better fit than a production role on a game. Frankly, they <em>both</em> sound like a lot of fun to me! On the one hand, I love driving business and working with partner organizations to get things done. What EAP does is a lot of what has drawn me to consulting over and over, but with the added bonus of working on <em>games</em> as the product. On the other hand, I also love being on the ground, helping shape a piece of software into a full fledged product, which is more the role of a studio producer. I think I cannot go wrong applying for production jobs in EAP or elsewhere in EA. :) I tend to lean slightly toward EAP-style production over studio-production, but theyd both be a great time in my book.</p><p><strong>Looking For 3-5 Years Of Game Production Experience&mldr;</strong></p><p>We interwove a discussion of my background while we spoke about the DD role in general&ndash;we seemed to arrive at a consensus that I&rsquo;m a fit for DD in every way except for my limited game production experience, so were thinking of ways to ramp me quickly in that respect. After I got off the call I thought about the ways I&rsquo;ve been working to get up to speed on game development so far and I came up with a few things:</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ve befriended a number of producers, 2 developer CEOs, and a number of other industry veterans whom I speak with regularly in order to gain a better understanding of game production. I&rsquo;ve also joined the IGDA&rsquo;s committee on Quality of Life and I&rsquo;m contributing to a whitepaper and a panel at the next GDC. In that capacity I&rsquo;ve begun interviewing producers, developers, testers, and artists about their experiences&mldr;it&rsquo;s been an invaluable learning experience.</li><li>I have read most of the production articles on Gamasutra and I plan on rereading them before my first day of work. I&rsquo;ve also started on the postmortems. Between these two sections I&rsquo;ve found some helpful insights into the issues specific to game production. I&rsquo;ve found a lot of parallels where my experience will apply well and I&rsquo;ve had the chance to identify a number of areas I want to learn more.</li><li>Other books on my reading list before day 1 of work are: <em>Game Design: Theory & Practice</em>, <em>Game Architecture and Design</em> and <em>Masters of Doom</em>. Besides being a quick learner (I love learning, it&rsquo;s one of my hobbies), I happen to be a very good book learner and these books have been praised for their insights into game development.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve spent the last several months becoming familiar with the game industry itself&ndash;how it works, who the players are, where the money is, and where the tea leaves appear to be pointing. I feel I have a solid beginning grasp of the business which I expect will help me understand what my boss and my boss&rsquo;s boss are trying to accomplish.</li><li>Being a lifelong gamer, it&rsquo;s no big sacrifice to buy and play a few more of the latest games. ;) Lately I&rsquo;ve been playing The Sims, SimCity 4, Battlefield: 1942, Homeworld 2, Fatal Frame, Battle Realms, Jedi Outcast, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and American McGee&rsquo;s Alice not only for my personal enjoyment, but also with a critical eye towards how they are built, why they are or are not fun, and what their target market is. I&rsquo;ve started a notebook where I record the high points and low point of each so I can apply what I&rsquo;ve learned to future projects.</li></ul><p><strong>Coming Up</strong></p><p>It does sound a bit salesie unfortunately, but I wanted to follow up promptly so I just did the brain dump&ndash;I emailed these to John shortly after our call. I&rsquo;ve thought of a number of ways that I&rsquo;ll be able to work on it once I&rsquo;m on board, but I&rsquo;ll save that for my next interview. John tells me the next step is to setup a call with the <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=5637/">Craig Alexander</a>, the hiring manager. Craig sounds like a very busy guy though, and I didnt get the impression they are trying to fill the spot to meet a deadline, so I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll hear from him sometime in the next few weeks.</p></div></body></html>
