<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p><strong>Alan Writes:</strong></p><p><em>First off, excellent site. I commend you on your creativity and tenacity in achieving your goal. Great job. | I&rsquo;m a screenwriter thats had moderate Hollywood success. Moderate being defined in that I&rsquo;ve sold two scripts to Hollywood production companies but nothing made (yet). I also have a background in I.T. (all areas of project life cycle). | My question is, do you know if EA employs a staff of writers? (For clarification, I&rsquo;m not talking about the copywriters or those who write manuals, but those writers who deal in storyline, dialogue, and character development). I hear developers are bringing in screenwriters and was curious if EA is one of them.</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>I asked around EA and heard: &ldquo;Yes, there are a couple of people here who are capable, and some even accomplished, writers who are also capable game designers. As a writer only, we usually work with them on a contract basis versus an employee because you don&rsquo;t really want a generalist but the best guy at a particular style of writing or story-telling that you want to enhance you game experience.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Alan&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
