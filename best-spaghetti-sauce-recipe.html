<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/food.html>#food</a></div><p>For me there is no better spaghetti sauce that the stuff I grew up with. Period. I grew up on this stuff and maybe that&rsquo;s got something to do with it, but when I make my friends have no problem polishing off a plateful and coming back for more.</p><p>My dad learned his first version of this recipe while working in an Italian restaurant in college. He made it a bunch of times while studying at Berkeley because, besides tasting great, it can be made in big batches and it refrigerates well (up to about 2 weeks). Over the last 30 years he&rsquo;s tried a lot of different things before arriving at the recipe I present to you. I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I looked forward to eating this when my dad made it when I was a kid. Enjoy!</p><p><strong>Grandpa Bonds&rsquo; Spaghetti Sauce</strong></p><p>Get a big pot. Chop a large yellow onion and fry it in grape seed oil in the pot until they are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add 1 lb of ground beef to the onions and cook until the meat is brown, about 2 minutes. Add 2x 1 quart cans of Italian tomatoes in basil (they look like tubes rather than spheres). Chop the tomatoes you just put in into 2 or 3 pieces each. Add 2x 1 cup cans of tomatoes sauce. Add 2x 8oz cans of tomato paste. Add a tablespoon of brown sugar. Add 4 cloves of finely chopped or pressed garlic. Add 1 tablespoon of oregano, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp basil. Add 1 cup red wine (I use Burgundy). Add 2 bay leaves. Add 2 tsp salt. Smell it. Good huh? Cook for 4-5 hours on low heat. Stir every 10-15 minutes. When it&rsquo;s done, it should be very thick. Serve over spaghetti noodles. I like to make garlic bread to go with it.</p><p><em>Updated on September 30th, 2013</em></p><p>Changed &lsquo;Dad&rsquo; to &lsquo;Grandpa&rsquo;.</p></div></body></html>
