fuss over Nix is all about though. My needs are simple: I want
to install and uninstall software on my Mac. It would be
nice to have a list of apps I use that I can check into git
if I feel like it, but that&amp;rsquo;s just a nice-to-have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First I tried out vanilla nix (the package manager, not the OS), then
home-manager, then home-manager with flakes. I landed on &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/download.html">nix&lt;/a> plus
&lt;a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Non-NixOS">flakes&lt;/a>, no home-manager, plus some &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/bonds/1cb0ae202dbe409aebb81b1f1feacbc4">wrapper scripts&lt;/a> to make it

since switching to Vim (from Atom) I hadn&amp;rsquo;t setup the necessary plugins in Vim
to get syntax checking and such for Haskell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing as Stack is the new Haskell installer hotness, I installed it and used it
to install a bunch of &amp;lsquo;global&amp;rsquo; packages for use with my runghc based scripts. I
installed ghc-mod and hlint, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any error messages when I messed
up the syntax of my Haskell code. A bit of investigation revealed that Syntactic
dropped support for ghc-mod, but that hdevtools was supported. I installed that,
loaded my Haskell code into Vim, and this time I got errors about missing
libraries. I realized hdevtools was looking for the libraries in the system GHC
instead of using my global Stack based libraries. To get it to use the global

&lt;p>After saving and restarting Terminal, running &amp;lsquo;pgr&amp;rsquo; will find all the
postgres process and kill them. Once launchd notices postgres is down it
restarts it because I setup launchd to keep postgres running no matter
what. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have postgres setup to stay running, you would need
to start postgres whatever way matches your setup. I tried a number of
different solutions before I arrived at this one:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Automatically Connect and Stay Connected to a Network Drive on OS X</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-automatically-connect-and-stay-connected-to-a-network-drive-on-os-x.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2011 18:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-automatically-connect-and-stay-connected-to-a-network-drive-on-os-x.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/automount_screenshot.jpg" alt="8">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I looked around for an easier way to post an &lt;strong>internal&lt;/strong> IP to DynDNS,
but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find one. Scripting to the rescue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a paid account at DynDNS (may work for free ones too, I&amp;rsquo;m

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s more than way to go about it, but I prefer using the open source
ClamAV and a script that runs to scan each email as it comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Setup ClamAV&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Install &lt;a href="http://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV&lt;/a>. I used &lt;a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts&lt;/a> to install it:
&lt;code>sudo port install clamav&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure all the ClamAV binaries are in your PATH. Chances are
if you&amp;rsquo;re using MacPorts, you&amp;rsquo;ve already taken care of that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure freshclam and clamd. Since I used MacPorts to install
ClamAV, this consisted of&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rename the example conf files in /opt/local/etc: &lt;code>mv example-freshclam.conf freshclam.conf;&lt;/code> &lt;code>mv example-clamd.conf clamd.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>read the conf files and edit them as appropriate, then add the line
&lt;code>NotifyClamd /opt/local/etc/clamd.conf (&lt;/code>substituting the full path to
your clamd.conf file) to the end of freshclam.conf so that clamd knows
about it when freshclam has updated the virus definitions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run freshclam to see if it works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>notice that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because it needs permissions to certain
directories; &lt;code>sudo chown -R &amp;lt;clamav user&amp;gt; &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&amp;hellip;the directory
you need to update will be clear based on the error message, the user
that freshclam and clamd run under is configured in the conf files. In
the MacPorts case its &amp;lsquo;clamav&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rinse and repeat until freshclam works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run clamd to see if it works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fix its permissions too&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run clamdscan to check that it can scan some files using clamdscan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html">launchd&lt;/a> items for freshclam and clamd. Freshclam
should run every 168 hours or so. Clamd should run all the time.
I recommend using &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingon/files/">Lingon&lt;/a> to configure your launchd items.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot. Check to see that clamd is running. Fix it if its
not.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Setup Growl&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Use Facebook Open Streams With Facebooker</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-use-facebook-open-streams-with-facebooker.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2009 15:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-use-facebook-open-streams-with-facebooker.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/facebook_extended_permissions.jpg" alt="1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would like my Facebook Connect app to publish stories to my users&amp;rsquo; Facebook news stream. I went looking for how do this with Facebooker and figured out an answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The old way of doing this, and the one built into Facebooker, is to &lt;a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/classes/Facebooker/Rails/Publisher.html">publish a user action&lt;/a>. There are two limitations of the old way: 1: you need a valid session_key (so, the user must be logged in); 2: you may only send up to 10 messages per day (without special permissions from the user). Fortunately Facebook released their Open Stream API in April 2009 and it suffers from neither restriction: you can post without a session_key and there are no explicit limits on how many posts you can make in a day. Unfortunately Facebooker does not yet offer native support for publishing to Facebook streams, at least that I could find, but it DOES support rolling your own API calls, and in this case its not that hard to do. To post to a users&amp;rsquo; Facebook stream from your Rails app&amp;rsquo;s script/console, do the following:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Include a Gem's Rake Tasks in Your Rails App</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-include-a-gems-rake-tasks-in-your-rails-app.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2009 12:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-include-a-gems-rake-tasks-in-your-rails-app.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Rake tasks contained in a gem are not automatically available to a rails app that requires the gem. Whether that&amp;rsquo;s the right way to do things is &lt;a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/59">under debate&lt;/a>, but in the mean time there are a couple workarounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option #1&lt;/strong>: Use the gem as a plugin instead. Files that match the following pattern are automatically pulled in, so you&amp;rsquo;re good to go:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option #2&lt;/strong>: Create a ruby file that loads the gem&amp;rsquo;s tasks, then require the ruby file you made in your rail app&amp;rsquo;s Rakefile. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;ve installed the Facebooker gem and you want to use its rake tasks, you might create a file called &amp;lsquo;facebooker.rb&amp;rsquo; and save it to your &lt;em>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/tasks&lt;/em> directory with these contents:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Permit A Blank Email Field With AuthLogic</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-permit-a-blank-email-field-with-authlogic.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2009 12:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-permit-a-blank-email-field-with-authlogic.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/errors-from-blank-email-with-AuthLogic.jpg" alt="2">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Want more traffic from your friendly neighborhood search engine to your site? Here are some of the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tricks I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rule #1: make it easy for the search engines to see and understand your content&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>make as much content visible to users that are &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> logged in as you can&amp;ndash;search engines cannot login and they will not index any content that is behind a login barrier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use descriptive names for everything, including your domains, paths, pages, and assets, i.e. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;em>http&lt;/em>://&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->tofu-recipes&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.ggr.com/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;em>http&lt;/em>://ggr.com/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->recipes&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->how-to-make-tofu&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.html&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->tofu-raw-ingredients&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.jpg&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->include descriptive &amp;ldquo;alt&amp;rdquo; attributes in your image tags&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avoid JavaScript links&amp;ndash;search engines cannot click on them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>make certain all of your content is reachable within 3 clicks of the homepage, i.e. add a sitemap&lt;/li>
&lt;li>try surfing your site with a &lt;a href="http://lynx.isc.org/">text web browser&lt;/a> to get an idea what your site looks like to a search engine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
