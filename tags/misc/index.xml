This is the way. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve used Chef, Ansible, shell scripts, manually cowboy sysadmin knob twiddling, CloudFormation, Terraform and other means of wrangling the computers and software I manage and code &amp;gt; manual but NixOS takes it to the next level with a declarative &amp;gt; imperative approach to configuring a Linux box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not all roses. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to invest real time before I&amp;rsquo;ll have wrapped my head around the Nix language&amp;hellip;and without that I&amp;rsquo;m groping around in the dark at times. I&amp;rsquo;ve already bruised my head on Haskell, another functional language, so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad. A lot has changed over the years and plenty of example configs and ideas and docs that were right before are outdated now, so&amp;hellip;more groping.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mbsync Is Way Faster Than Offlineimap</title><link>https://ggr.com/mbsync-is-way-faster-than-offlineimap.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2016 19:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/mbsync-is-way-faster-than-offlineimap.html</guid><description>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re in the market for a tool that syncs your email over IMAP, I recommend
you check out mbsync. On my hefty machine, offlineimap takes many minutes to
sync, all the while pegging a CPU at 100% and slowing my machine to a crawl. On
the other hand, mbsync sips 5% CPU, finishes much faster, and has no noticeable
impact on me while doing other tasks on the same machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Predictions</title><link>https://ggr.com/some-predictions.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/some-predictions.html</guid><description>&lt;p>By 2020 OpenBSD will be in the top 25 on Distrowatch, because of an increased
interest in security. By 2025 US legislation will have shifted the cost of poor
software security practices from the consumer to the website/software maker in
the US. By 2030 all the mainstream (desktop and server) operating systems will
be open source and sponsored/supported by at least one large (for profit)
company.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact Sales</title><link>https://ggr.com/contact-sales.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 15:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/contact-sales.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr.com/images/contact-sales.jpg" alt="a salesperson paywall">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These days it seems that a lot of SaaS tools are offering a free tier, one or
more paid tiers, and an &amp;rsquo;enterprise&amp;rsquo; tier, which, unlike the other tiers, has
amazing new capabilities but no price. Or rather, the price is &amp;lsquo;contact sales&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That price is too high for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to contact sales. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to
waste time listening to a pitch, hearing the retail price, hearing what a great
deal they&amp;rsquo;re willing to offer me off the retail price because I&amp;rsquo;m special and
there&amp;rsquo;s a blue moon tonight. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to email a bunch of my friends and
scour forums digging for the &lt;em>real&lt;/em> pricing scale, to make sure I&amp;rsquo;m not getting
ripped off. I don&amp;rsquo;t want a multiyear contract that keeps me paying for a service
even if its no longer right for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Background Processes On the Brain</title><link>https://ggr.com/background-processes-on-the-brain.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 00:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/background-processes-on-the-brain.html</guid><description>&lt;p>When I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of a hard thought problem (i.e. coding) and I
interrupt my work on the thought problem to do something else, I find it
difficult to concentrate on the something else. I think my brain is
still working on the hard thought problem in the background, sort of
like a CPU that&amp;rsquo;s still processing a different job&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m not fully
available to focus on the dinner party or new project at hand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wishlist Upgraded</title><link>https://ggr.com/wishlist-upgraded.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2014 23:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/wishlist-upgraded.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I moved my wishlist from Amazon to &lt;a href="http://camelcamelcamel.com">CamelCamelCamel&lt;/a>. I use my wishlist mostly as
a check on my impulses&amp;ndash;when I want something I add it to the wishlist instead
of buying it. It feels almost as satisfying and I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent any money. Every so
often I go through my wishlist to see if I still want the stuff on there. About 3/4
of the stuff gets eliminated, the rest I eventually buy. But since there&amp;rsquo;s no
urgency, I like to find a good deal first, that&amp;rsquo;s where CamelCamelCamel comes in.
They monitor everything I want and let me know when the price drops below a target
I&amp;rsquo;ve set.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Predict The Future Using Excel</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-predict-the-future-using-excel.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2009 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-predict-the-future-using-excel.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hard-drive-prediction.png" alt="3">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So you &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/how-to-sell-a-used-book.html">sold your used book&lt;/a> on Amazon, you&amp;rsquo;re basking in the glow of your success, and then it dawns on you that the buyer is expecting you to &lt;em>send them the book&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No worries, here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it: 1) print the packing slip from Amazon; 2) put the book in a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/10-5x16-BUBBLE-MAILERS-PADDED-ENVELOPES/dp/B000GHURA0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=office-products&amp;amp;qid=1243454116&amp;amp;sr=8-1">padded envelope&lt;/a> with the packing slip; 3) address the package to the buyer; 4) &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultraship-Electronic-Digital-Shipping-Kitchen/dp/B000FSWB9K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=home-garden&amp;amp;qid=1243454186&amp;amp;sr=8-1">weigh&lt;/a> the package; 5) &lt;a href="http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/Notice123.htm#2157064">look up the postage&lt;/a>; 6) put the right &lt;a href="http://shop.usps.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductCategoryDisplay?catalogId=10152&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;categoryId=11834&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=11826&amp;amp;top_category=11826&amp;amp;WT.ac=11834">postage&lt;/a> on there; 7) write &amp;lsquo;media mail&amp;rsquo; beneath the stamps on the package;8) stop by your local post office and drop it off in person.

&lt;p>They &lt;em>do&lt;/em> look good on your bookshelf, but are you really ever going to read them again? You can free up space in your home, save the environment, and spread knowledge throughout the world by getting that book off your shelf into the hands of an eager reader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the easiest ways is through &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=mm_sys_ind_learn?nodeId=1161232">Amazon&lt;/a>:&amp;ndash;do a search for your book, click on the &amp;lsquo;sell yours here&amp;rsquo; button, and you&amp;rsquo;re on your way. If you are feeling philanthropic you can sell your book for as little as $0.01 plus shipping. Or charge what it&amp;rsquo;s really worth and you&amp;rsquo;ll earn some dough for something new to read. &amp;ndash;Works great for old games too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Get More Outlet Space</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-get-more-outlet-space.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2009 16:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-get-more-outlet-space.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cord3.jpg" alt="3">&lt;/p>
