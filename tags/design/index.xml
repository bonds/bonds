&lt;p>There comes a time in every professional&amp;rsquo;s career when they need a graph. Maybe they need to illustrate &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/a-usability-scale.html">a usability scale&lt;/a>, maybe its something else. Fortunately, the developers at Omni are focused on making it stupid-easy to make graphs&amp;ndash;no need to bust open Excel, dust off any math skills, or crack open a book on Photoshop to make the graph you need.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many usability professionals focus on, well, usability. But there&amp;rsquo;s more to usability than an intuitive interface. The best stuff in our lives are pleasant, fun, even habit forming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Scott Bonds Usability Scale&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Unusable. Not useful or usable in any sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Functional. Very useful, but requires instruction (manual, training, demo, etc) before a desired feature is understood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Usable. Intuitive, requires little instruction before the user is proficient.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pleasant. Using it is satisfying and enjoyable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fun. Use it for its own sake, possibly independent of its core &amp;lsquo;function&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Addictive. So fun its difficulty to give up its regular use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Products that achieve scores above a 2, beyond &amp;lsquo;mere&amp;rsquo; usability (which is itself tremendously hard to achieve), tend to enjoy more success than their competition. There are some &lt;a href="http://www.upassoc.org/usability_resources/conference/2004/UPA-2004-TullisStetson.pdf">other usability scales&lt;/a> available as well as good advice about how to &lt;a href="http://www.sensible.com/secondedition/index.html">gather feedback&lt;/a> to assess where your project lands on this scale.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
