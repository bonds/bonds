Maybe they need to illustrate a usability scale, maybe its something else.

The Scott Bonds Usability Scale
Unusable. Not useful or usable in any sense. Functional. Very useful, but requires instruction (manual, training, demo, etc) before a desired feature is understood. Usable. Intuitive, requires little instruction before the user is proficient. Pleasant. Using it is satisfying and enjoyable.</description></item></channel></rss>
