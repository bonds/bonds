Coldstone&amp;rsquo;s the latest craze and gelato has enjoyed a recent surge in the Berkeley, CA area. But they&amp;rsquo;re all pretenders to the Double Rainbow throne.
Double Rainbow makes the best ice cream I&amp;rsquo;ve had outside of homemade. Gelato&amp;rsquo;s great and all, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take a scoop of DR over any gelato I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had as well. Try the chocolate chip.</description></item><item><title>Barley Soup</title><link>https://ggr.com/barley-soup.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2006 23:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/barley-soup.html</guid><description>Makes about 8 servings.

It&amp;rsquo;s a family owned chain that&amp;rsquo;s known for it&amp;rsquo;s simple menu, good service, and excellent hamburgers (the fries are really good too).
I&amp;rsquo;ve had burgers at joints across the country, from McDonald&amp;rsquo;s to mom-and-pop burger stands and I always come back to In-N-Out. What sets In-N-Out apart from most fast food restaurants are their quality, health conscious ingredients.</description></item><item><title>Best Seafood Pasta</title><link>https://ggr.com/best-seafood-pasta.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2006 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/best-seafood-pasta.html</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not as good as homemade but Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s has had the same special for 5 years: linguini with baby clams, shrimp, and mussels; and it&amp;rsquo;s really good.
The place has a fun atmosphere, there&amp;rsquo;s rarely a long wait, and they serve gummy bears for desert. Oh, and if there is a wait, ask them to break you off a chunk of parmesan from their 20 lb. block of cheese or grab some yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s usually near the entrance.</description></item><item><title>Spaghetti Sauce</title><link>https://ggr.com/spaghetti-sauce.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 14:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/spaghetti-sauce.html</guid><description>Makes 10 servings.

I&amp;rsquo;m accustom to the frozen variety and the bar food variety of fish and chips, and let me tell you this is different. They take good, fresh, gourmet quality fish and fry it up. Add some tartar sauce and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go.</description></item><item><title>Best Corned Beef Hash</title><link>https://ggr.com/best-corned-beef-hash.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2005 13:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/best-corned-beef-hash.html</guid><description>Whenever I visit my family in the LA area I try to find my way to Billy&amp;rsquo;s in Glendale for an order of corned beef hashand an order of hash brown potatoes (with plenty of ketchup). Billy&amp;rsquo;s makes their own corned beef hash and it&amp;rsquo;s excellent. I have tried corned beef hash at many other restaurants trying to find something this good closer to my home in San Francisco; I&amp;rsquo;ve searched high and low, but I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to find a comparable hash.</description></item><item><title>Spanish Sweet Bread</title><link>https://ggr.com/spanish-sweet-bread.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2005 12:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/spanish-sweet-bread.html</guid><description>Bread Machine Variant Makes 1 loaf.
