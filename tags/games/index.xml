&lt;p>A couple months ago my wife got locked out of Steam while trying to remember her
password and we had to give up on a rare chance to play some Don&amp;rsquo;t Starve
Together, um, together. It got me thinking&amp;hellip;DRM is a pain in the butt
sometimes. I wonder what FOSS games are out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out there are some rather good ones available, unless your aim is showing
off how much you can spend on a game system. That&amp;rsquo;s not my aim&amp;ndash;a while ago I
realized that the best gameplay is not coming out of the game industry&amp;rsquo;s big
budget blockbuster hit machines, but from indies plying their art as best they
can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Passage Moved Me</title><link>https://ggr.com/passage-moved-me.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2009 10:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/passage-moved-me.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/passage.jpg" alt="3">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not knowing what to expect, I played &lt;a href="http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/">Passage&lt;/a> and found myself moved (not in the U-Haul sense, the other moved)&amp;hellip;something no other video game has accomplished before or since. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much, but there&amp;rsquo;s real &lt;a href="http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F">Art&lt;/a> in there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Braid Is a Beautiful Game</title><link>https://ggr.com/braid-is-a-beautiful-game.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2009 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/braid-is-a-beautiful-game.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/braid.png" alt="2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You had me at hello&lt;/em>. &amp;ndash;Wait&amp;hellip;I mean: &lt;em>you had me at the start up screen&lt;/em>. &amp;ndash;&lt;a href="http://braid-game.com/">Braid&lt;/a> would make a great screensaver, it&amp;rsquo;s that neat to look at (and listen to). And for those who like side-scrollers, there&amp;rsquo;s a fun, innovative game in there too. The (free) demo is worth the price of admission and then some.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
