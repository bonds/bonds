towards becoming broadly useful operating systems, I installed them on some real
hardware, took them for a spin, and thought about what it would take for them to
take over the world&amp;hellip;what market &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586">position&lt;/a> is available and accessible to a
potential, future, Genode based OS?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So. Would you be interesting in an OS that can say &lt;em>this&lt;/em> (with a straight
face)?:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uncrashable. Genode will never crash, ever, when run on properly functioning
hardware. Go ahead and try, we dare you. For good measure there&amp;rsquo;s a formal proof
of Genode&amp;rsquo;s uncrashability and it matches experience of real users&amp;ndash;Genode is
the most stable, reliable, general purpose operating system available, open
source or proprietary, bar none. In fact, its able to detect and recover from
many &lt;em>hardware&lt;/em> bugs, to the point that Genode is the tool of choice by
integrators trying to track down bad hardware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Burst > Drip For iTunes Review Reminders</title><link>https://ggr.com/burst-drip-for-itunes-review-reminders.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 15:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/burst-drip-for-itunes-review-reminders.html</guid><description>&lt;p>We email our customers after they receive their first &lt;a href="http://heymosaic.com">Mosaic&lt;/a>, asking
them to submit a review to the iTunes (or Google Play) store. We used to send
each email a few days after their package arrived, but we discovered that when
we save up a whole bunch of the reminders, say a month&amp;rsquo;s worth, and send them
all at once, it leads to more reviews, even though its the exact same number of
people contacted, and for some people more time has lapsed between their order
and the email.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
