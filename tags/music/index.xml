&lt;p>For months I struggled with frequent audio dropouts while connecting to
stereo through my Airport Express from my Mac laptop. My connection was
strong (5/5 bars on wifi) but I still had dropouts. I tried every manner
of fix and none was satisfactory. Until now. I seem to have stumbled on
a solution and its one I had not read about before. No doubt it won&amp;rsquo;t
work for everyone because of the many different possible causes for bad
connectivity to your AirTunes device of choice. But here&amp;rsquo;s what worked
for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pandora vs Last.fm</title><link>https://ggr.com/pandora-vs-last.fm.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2010 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/pandora-vs-last.fm.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pandora-vs-last.fm_.jpg" alt="4">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re both good, but &lt;a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm&lt;/a> wins. How can this be? Last.fm&amp;rsquo;s
amazing powers are put on display after the break.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last.fm can perform these amazing tricks:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>** Tag (and Multitag) radio**. If you want to listen to &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo;
music on Pandora, you have to select a song or artist that exemplifies
&amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo;, then vote up/down songs until Pandora figures out what you
want. On Last.fm, you can simply tell it to play a radio station
made up of music that has the &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; tag. Multitag stations are
particularly powerful because you can further refine your selection,
i.e. &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;happy&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
