My connection was strong (5/5 bars on wifi) but I still had dropouts. I tried every manner of fix and none was satisfactory. Until now.

Last.fm can perform these amazing tricks:
** Tag (and Multitag) radio**. If you want to listen to &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; music on Pandora, you have to select a song or artist that exemplifies &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo;, then vote up/down songs until Pandora figures out what you want. On Last.fm, you can simply tell it to play a radio station made up of music that has the &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; tag.</description></item></channel></rss>
