(if he likes it and can get all this done and add some stuff to it. you can take all the credit if he doesnt like it you can say you got it from a kid who wants to work at ea when he gets older</p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>Cool idea! I think you should start a discussion on a games site1s forums about it and see what the other fans think. The creators of all these games read forums to learn what people like and dislike about the game so they can make the next version even better. If you can get a lot of people talking about your idea, you never know</p><p>Regardless, definitely write this one down and start a game idea folder. It will be a really great thing to have years down the road when you are making games of your own. And you dont have to wait for programming skills to do ityou could even turn this idea into a board game or a card game. Believe it or not, a lot of computer games use the same concepts that board games use&ndash;they just have better graphics on top. If you can make a board game that captures the fun of &ldquo;become an NBA star&rdquo; then you would really have something.</p><p>BTW, <a href=http://www.sloperama.com/advice/idea.htm>here&rsquo;s</a> a great article on how to take your game ideas forward. Good to hear from you and good luck!</p></div></body></html>
