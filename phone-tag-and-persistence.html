<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>My friend Auren emailed me an introduction to Tiffany Spencer who is a PR Manager (as best I can tellshe works out of SF and Ubisofts SF office is a <a href=https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/about_ubisoft/world_presence/biz_northamerica.aspx>marketing office</a>) for <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft>Ubisoft</a>. She emailed me once last week but I havent been able to reach her since. Perhaps shes out of town or very busy. I am reminded of how many times I have had to contact a person 10 times or more before I finally got a hold of them. And most times it totally paid off. The reasons why people take a while can be all over the map, it pays not to take it personally and just realize that there are probably some perfectly good reasonsand in any case, it&rsquo;s usually worth the wait.</p><p><em>Updated on October 6th, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
