<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p><a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20040409001128/http://jobs1.ea.com/eaacademy/index.html>EA Academy</a> recently <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20040219165249/http://jobs1.ea.com/eaacademy/gettingin.html>linked</a> to this site and the email has been coming in a bit faster&mldr;and its started me thinking about what direction to take the site next. I&rsquo;m working on putting up some forums so more people can check out the questions and discussions that have been happening in email and blog comments up to this point. I bet there are some people who visit this site on occasion who know a lot more than I do about breaking into the industry and might be happy to help out as well!</p><p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have the forums up and running next weekI&rsquo;m waiting on my ISP to respond to my request to set up what I need to get going.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also starting to think about who I want to meet next at EAI&rsquo;ve been busying myself with the work at hand for the past few weeks, but Id like to start branching out again, maybe spend a couple lunches a week meeting new people at EA. Its a whole lot of fun just to sit down with new people and chat about what they do, and I expect it will be that much easier to get in touch with people from an EA email address. :)</p><p><em>Updated on October 10th, 2013</em></p><p>Replaced the broken links with Archive.org links.</p></div></body></html>
