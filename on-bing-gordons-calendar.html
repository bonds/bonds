<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>I feel very lucky to have been introduced to <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,11/>Bing Gordon</a> by <a href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html>Neil Young</a>. Bing has offered to meet with me in a week and a half where well no doubt have the chance to speak about a number of interesting topics. Id love to hear the tales he has from the <a href=/the-ea-way.html>early days</a> of EAhes one of the 7 original founders from back in 1982. That makes him one of the rock stars of the industry&mldr;I can hardly believe I get to sit down with him! Its going to be awesome. I feel like I&rsquo;m going up to the mountain and meeting the guru to learn who-knows-what pearls of wisdom.</p></div></body></html>
