<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/management.html>#management</a></div><p>Scrum Master is a greatly misunderstood and under appreciated role. On most
teams I&rsquo;ve encountered its taken on by the PO or its ignored entirely. I&rsquo;m
guilty of this sin myself and when <em>I</em> am not ignoring it, I&rsquo;m playing scrum
master across way too many teams, in addition to way too many other duties, so
its not done terribly well&mldr;better than nothing I suppose, but better is
possible, and, I think, a good investment.</p><p>It seems to me that a Scrum Master is like a personal trainer for a group of
people. Some people are disciplined and are able to get a good workout on their
own, some people are less disciplined and struggle to get results at the gym.
But where ever you are on the spectrum, having a personal trainer who spends
time with you, helping you use the right technique and offering motivational
support to help you push a bit harder on the workout or when controlling your
eating habits, can have a huge impact on your rate of progress and your final
result.</p><p>Without a personal trainer the groups&rsquo; results suffer not just a little, but a
lot. A personal trainer that&rsquo;s spread out over 20 people is better than no
personal trainer at all, but much better results may be achieved by adding
another personal trainer.</p><p>My guess is a good scrum master that&rsquo;s not spread out can boost their team&rsquo;s
productivity by 20-50% depending on their proficiency with scrum, their level of
interruption, and their seniority. Besides that, its more fun being more
productive, so there is a morale benefit. In short, a good scrum master per
scrum team readily pays for themselves.</p></div></body></html>
