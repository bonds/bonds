Their group ends up worse off. Divisive leaders optimize for a subgroup and the &amp;lsquo;in&amp;rsquo; group is more happy, the &amp;lsquo;out&amp;rsquo; group is less happy. They are playing a zero-sum game. Selfish leaders are an extreme of the divisive leader&amp;ndash;the selfish leader IS the &amp;lsquo;in&amp;rsquo; group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good leaders choose a goal where everyone wins, and they achieve it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NixOS Is Great</title><link>https://ggr.com/nixos-is-great.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 00:22:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/nixos-is-great.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally got around to trying out NixOS. This is the way. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve used Chef, Ansible, shell scripts, manually cowboy sysadmin knob twiddling, CloudFormation, Terraform and other means of wrangling the computers and software I manage and code &amp;gt; manual but NixOS takes it to the next level with a declarative &amp;gt; imperative approach to configuring a Linux box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not all roses. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to invest real time before I&amp;rsquo;ll have wrapped my head around the Nix language&amp;hellip;and without that I&amp;rsquo;m groping around in the dark at times. I&amp;rsquo;ve already bruised my head on Haskell, another functional language, so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad. A lot has changed over the years and plenty of example configs and ideas and docs that were right before are outdated now, so&amp;hellip;more groping.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cheese Fondue</title><link>https://ggr.com/cheese-fondue.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 23:01:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/cheese-fondue.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Makes 2 servings.&lt;/p>

Google should
totally &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695102">give him a job&lt;/a>. Recently I thought I&amp;rsquo;d see what the
fuss over Nix is all about though. My needs are simple: I want
to install and uninstall software on my Mac. It would be
nice to have a list of apps I use that I can check into git
if I feel like it, but that&amp;rsquo;s just a nice-to-have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First I tried out vanilla nix (the package manager, not the OS), then
home-manager, then home-manager with flakes. I landed on &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/download.html">nix&lt;/a> plus
&lt;a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Non-NixOS">flakes&lt;/a>, no home-manager, plus some &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/bonds/1cb0ae202dbe409aebb81b1f1feacbc4">wrapper scripts&lt;/a> to make it
stupid easy to use&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t need all the knobs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bread Pudding</title><link>https://ggr.com/bread-pudding.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:29:48 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/bread-pudding.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Makes 8 servings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The other game to be played is the &lt;strong>1+1=4&lt;/strong> game. It&amp;rsquo;s the game
of abundance, of creating a bigger pie, of win-wins that benefit everyone.
It&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder to pull off.
It requires leadership and shared culture (which also requires leadership).

&lt;p>I must speak up in public forums like LinkedIN, Twitter, and Christmas dinner. I’ve been taught that talking politics is impolite. But leaving good ideas unsaid and undefended, and letting bad ideas dominate the conversation and lead to bad decisions is even more impolite.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="change-my-mind">Change My Mind&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I must listen, learn, and change my mind, which is way harder than defending my beliefs and standing my ground. It requires humility to admit I was wrong and courage to let others see my mistakes. I have to love my community enough to do what’s right for us instead of what makes me look good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Commitment</title><link>https://ggr.com/on-commitment.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 17:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/on-commitment.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Imagine you have a team of 5, a leader plus 4 others. The leader chooses not to
contribute ideas, preferring to select from the ideas of his team. The team
members are equally persuasive and generate equally good and viable ideas, but
the ideas are as opposite/orthogonal/different as they can be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team has decided to make decisions together and fully commit to those
decisions, so all their creative, persuasive, and intellectual energy operates
in concert. They recognize that to do otherwise, to decide individually what to
do and then work individually to accomplish their individual goals will lead to
everyone spending tremendous energy to&amp;hellip;cancel each other out and go
nowhere. It is better to be wrong together than to be right separately,
because being wrong together offers the prospect to progress and learn, and
eventually move in the right direction together, with great energy and
speed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Companies Are Made of People</title><link>https://ggr.com/companies-are-made-of-people.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:52:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/companies-are-made-of-people.html</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve adopted the &lt;a href="https://www.tablegroup.com/books/">Patrick Lencioni&lt;/a> stack at Mixbook.

since switching to Vim (from Atom) I hadn&amp;rsquo;t setup the necessary plugins in Vim

&lt;p>Seeing as Stack is the new Haskell installer hotness, I installed it and used it

installed ghc-mod and hlint, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any error messages when I messed
up the syntax of my Haskell code. A bit of investigation revealed that Syntactic
dropped support for ghc-mod, but that hdevtools was supported. I installed that,
loaded my Haskell code into Vim, and this time I got errors about missing

&lt;p>Perhaps the goal should be to have objectives that &lt;em>require&lt;/em> innovation to

Security, like seaworthiness, is not a feature that&amp;rsquo;s well suited to being

our ISP and various 3rd party SaaS providers), I need to be patching every day

interest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>hours worked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tasks completed per hour worked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>unit of impact per task completed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="hours-worked">Hours Worked&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The company culture where you work sets the tone for how many hours you work.
Startups tend to value long hours, but plenty of larger companies do too. Adding
more hours can be very effective in the short-run, but in the long-run the gains
can be elusive, as people shift more of their personal chores and relaxation
time into their work hours in order to satisfy the expectation that they are in
the office all the time, while still striking the balance that they prefer.
There are plenty of tools to counterbalance the distractions and keep focused,
from inspired goals to deadlines to pressure from a boss, but they don&amp;rsquo;t scale
well. My guess is that its unusual to find a (knowledge worker) organization
that can sustain gains from long hours when properly accounting for hours &lt;em>not&lt;/em>
working (but in the office!), the cost of management time to maintain a long
hours culture, and the costs of employee churn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact Sales</title><link>https://ggr.com/contact-sales.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 15:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/contact-sales.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr.com/images/contact-sales.jpg" alt="a salesperson paywall">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These days it seems that a lot of SaaS tools are offering a free tier, one or
more paid tiers, and an &amp;rsquo;enterprise&amp;rsquo; tier, which, unlike the other tiers, has
amazing new capabilities but no price. Or rather, the price is &amp;lsquo;contact sales&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That price is too high for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to contact sales. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to
waste time listening to a pitch, hearing the retail price, hearing what a great
deal they&amp;rsquo;re willing to offer me off the retail price because I&amp;rsquo;m special and
there&amp;rsquo;s a blue moon tonight. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to email a bunch of my friends and
scour forums digging for the &lt;em>real&lt;/em> pricing scale, to make sure I&amp;rsquo;m not getting
ripped off. I don&amp;rsquo;t want a multiyear contract that keeps me paying for a service
even if its no longer right for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Scott Bonds Rules of Presentations</title><link>https://ggr.com/the-scott-bonds-rules-of-presentations.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/the-scott-bonds-rules-of-presentations.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got another deck to put together.

down the Scott Bonds Rules of Presentations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>entertain your audience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>do not forget to make your point&lt;/li>
&lt;li>do not put text on your slides&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="entertain-your-audience">Entertain Your Audience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is the first rule because its the most important. When you
entertain your audience, you make them into better listeners. They are
more engaged, more open minded, and more likely to absorb and retain
your message. They are also more likely to want to hear you speak again.

really stand out, even in their hobbies. You see stuff like &lt;em>1st place in the
Chicago Assembler Speed Competition&lt;/em> on A engineers&amp;rsquo; resumes. Designers point
to a portfolio that you look at and go &amp;lsquo;wow&amp;rsquo;. Managers talk about team

&lt;p>With Arch Linux you do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>boot the Arch Linux CD (in your Qemu guest)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>press tab to config the boot command&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add a space and then &amp;rsquo;noapic&amp;rsquo; to the boot command&lt;/li>

decisions are adding value a year after they are released; let&amp;rsquo;s say a
rockstar achieves 2 in 5. The team building what the rockstar designer
chose are happier (more of their work has an impact), their customers
are happier (better &amp;lsquo;awesome&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;meh&amp;rsquo; ratio for new features), and

&lt;p>When a software company is searching for a new CTO or VP of Engineering,
they tend to look for either a Chief of Surgery or a Head Coach. Hiring
the right (or wrong) one can mean the difference between success and
failure as a company. Knowing which you are can help you choose the
right opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Chief of Surgery&lt;/strong> is one of the best, if not the best, software
engineer at the company. Often they are career engineers with limited
management experience. But for a small startup where getting the code
right is critical and the CTO is 1/4 of the development team, the CoS
offers a huge boost in productivity by setting coding standards,
establishing the architecture, drawing the technology roadmap, and
coding like crazy.

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s more than way to go about it, but I prefer using the open source
ClamAV and a script that runs to scan each email as it comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Setup ClamAV&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Install &lt;a href="http://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV&lt;/a>. I used &lt;a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts&lt;/a> to install it:
&lt;code>sudo port install clamav&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure all the ClamAV binaries are in your PATH. Chances are
if you&amp;rsquo;re using MacPorts, you&amp;rsquo;ve already taken care of that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure freshclam and clamd. Since I used MacPorts to install
ClamAV, this consisted of&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rename the example conf files in /opt/local/etc: &lt;code>mv example-freshclam.conf freshclam.conf;&lt;/code> &lt;code>mv example-clamd.conf clamd.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>read the conf files and edit them as appropriate, then add the line
&lt;code>NotifyClamd /opt/local/etc/clamd.conf (&lt;/code>substituting the full path to
your clamd.conf file) to the end of freshclam.conf so that clamd knows
about it when freshclam has updated the virus definitions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run freshclam to see if it works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>notice that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because it needs permissions to certain
directories; &lt;code>sudo chown -R &amp;lt;clamav user&amp;gt; &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&amp;hellip;the directory
you need to update will be clear based on the error message, the user
that freshclam and clamd run under is configured in the conf files. In
the MacPorts case its &amp;lsquo;clamav&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rinse and repeat until freshclam works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run clamd to see if it works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fix its permissions too&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run clamdscan to check that it can scan some files using clamdscan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html">launchd&lt;/a> items for freshclam and clamd. Freshclam
should run every 168 hours or so. Clamd should run all the time.
I recommend using &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingon/files/">Lingon&lt;/a> to configure your launchd items.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot. Check to see that clamd is running. Fix it if its
not.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>I would like my Facebook Connect app to publish stories to my users&amp;rsquo; Facebook news stream. I went looking for how do this with Facebooker and figured out an answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The old way of doing this, and the one built into Facebooker, is to &lt;a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/classes/Facebooker/Rails/Publisher.html">publish a user action&lt;/a>. There are two limitations of the old way: 1: you need a valid session_key (so, the user must be logged in); 2: you may only send up to 10 messages per day (without special permissions from the user). Fortunately Facebook released their Open Stream API in April 2009 and it suffers from neither restriction: you can post without a session_key and there are no explicit limits on how many posts you can make in a day. Unfortunately Facebooker does not yet offer native support for publishing to Facebook streams, at least that I could find, but it DOES support rolling your own API calls, and in this case its not that hard to do. To post to a users&amp;rsquo; Facebook stream from your Rails app&amp;rsquo;s script/console, do the following:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Include a Gem's Rake Tasks in Your Rails App</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-include-a-gems-rake-tasks-in-your-rails-app.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2009 12:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-include-a-gems-rake-tasks-in-your-rails-app.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Rake tasks contained in a gem are not automatically available to a rails app that requires the gem.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option #1&lt;/strong>: Use the gem as a plugin instead. Files that match the following pattern are automatically pulled in, so you&amp;rsquo;re good to go:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option #2&lt;/strong>: Create a ruby file that loads the gem&amp;rsquo;s tasks, then require the ruby file you made in your rail app&amp;rsquo;s Rakefile. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;ve installed the Facebooker gem and you want to use its rake tasks, you might create a file called &amp;lsquo;facebooker.rb&amp;rsquo; and save it to your &lt;em>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/tasks&lt;/em> directory with these contents:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Permit A Blank Email Field With AuthLogic</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-permit-a-blank-email-field-with-authlogic.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2009 12:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-permit-a-blank-email-field-with-authlogic.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/errors-from-blank-email-with-AuthLogic.jpg" alt="2">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Want more traffic from your friendly neighborhood search engine to your site? Here are some of the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tricks I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rule #1: make it easy for the search engines to see and understand your content&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>make as much content visible to users that are &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> logged in as you can&amp;ndash;search engines cannot login and they will not index any content that is behind a login barrier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use descriptive names for everything, including your domains, paths, pages, and assets, i.e. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;em>http&lt;/em>://&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->tofu-recipes&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.ggr.com/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;em>http&lt;/em>://ggr.com/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->recipes&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->how-to-make-tofu&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.html&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->tofu-raw-ingredients&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.jpg&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->include descriptive &amp;ldquo;alt&amp;rdquo; attributes in your image tags&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avoid JavaScript links&amp;ndash;search engines cannot click on them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>make certain all of your content is reachable within 3 clicks of the homepage, i.e. add a sitemap&lt;/li>
&lt;li>try surfing your site with a &lt;a href="http://lynx.isc.org/">text web browser&lt;/a> to get an idea what your site looks like to a search engine&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Many usability professionals focus on, well, usability. But there&amp;rsquo;s more to usability than an intuitive interface. The best stuff in our lives are pleasant, fun, even habit forming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Scott Bonds Usability Scale&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Unusable. Not useful or usable in any sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Functional. Very useful, but requires instruction (manual, training, demo, etc) before a desired feature is understood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Usable. Intuitive, requires little instruction before the user is proficient.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pleasant. Using it is satisfying and enjoyable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fun. Use it for its own sake, possibly independent of its core &amp;lsquo;function&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Addictive. So fun its difficulty to give up its regular use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Products that achieve scores above a 2, beyond &amp;lsquo;mere&amp;rsquo; usability (which is itself tremendously hard to achieve), tend to enjoy more success than their competition. There are some &lt;a href="http://www.upassoc.org/usability_resources/conference/2004/UPA-2004-TullisStetson.pdf">other usability scales&lt;/a> available as well as good advice about how to &lt;a href="http://www.sensible.com/secondedition/index.html">gather feedback&lt;/a> to assess where your project lands on this scale.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Protect Your Pockets From Your Keys</title><link>https://ggr.com/how-to-protect-your-pockets-from-your-keys.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2009 17:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/how-to-protect-your-pockets-from-your-keys.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/keywallet.jpg" alt="2">&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a family owned chain that&amp;rsquo;s known for it&amp;rsquo;s simple menu, good service, and excellent hamburgers (the fries are really good too).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had burgers at joints across the country, from McDonald&amp;rsquo;s to mom-and-pop burger stands and I always come back to In-N-Out. What sets In-N-Out apart from most fast food restaurants are their quality, health conscious ingredients. You can, for example, watch them make your fries as you drive up. How do they make them? They chop up the potatoes, fry them in vegetable oil, and add salt. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Like everything they make the fries are made of fresh, not frozen, ingredients. The freshness comes through in the taste and avoiding preservative is probably a lot better for you too. If you want to be on the inside, you should know about some of the stuff they do just for people that notice that kind of stuff, aka crazy detail oriented fans. First is the &lt;a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx">hidden menu&lt;/a> of items you can order, but which they do not advertise. I recommend the 4x4. Second when you order a drink, look on the bottom of the cup. They print a bible verse there. Why? Who knows. Makes their cups seem more important somehow. So, you know, recycle them or something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Best Seafood Pasta</title><link>https://ggr.com/best-seafood-pasta.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2006 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/best-seafood-pasta.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not as good as &lt;a href="http://ggr.com/?p=9">homemade&lt;/a> but &lt;a href="http://local.google.com/local?q=michelangelo%27s&amp;amp;near=San+Francisco,+CA&amp;amp;sll=37.775000,-122.418333&amp;amp;sspn=1.128891,1.873169&amp;amp;t=&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;latlng=37775000,-122418333,9239044668248113722">Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> has had the same special for 5 years: linguini with baby clams, shrimp, and mussels; and it&amp;rsquo;s really good.&lt;/p>

We dont perceive the world as a raw stream of color and brightness&amp;ndash;we see objects that retain their integrity even as we turn our heads or they move around. Anyone whos written AI visual navigation/targeting systems can attest to what an impressive ability this is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our eyes and brain dont do this in one step. Much like a programer uses functions to organize code at different levels of abstraction so too our brain constructs the visual world in layers. First there are points, then lines, then other constructs like right-angles, and parallel lines. There are actually brain cells that detect parallel lines. All these primitives are used to form ever more complicate objects until we can look in a room and quickly identify a chair as a chair rather than a bunch of pixels impacting our retina.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Problem With Mr. Evil</title><link>https://ggr.com/the-problem-with-mr.-evil.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2004 23:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/the-problem-with-mr.-evil.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Maybe its just me, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired off all the comic book evil that we have in games these days.

That is to say comic book evil&amp;ndash;no grays here, pretty much anyone on the planet would judge the evil action as such. But evil in the real world is all about the shades of grey where otherwise good people keep pushing the boundaries of propriety one inch at a time all the while rationalize and justifying their actions. Its subtle and insidious. And its much more seductive and powerful than what I&amp;rsquo;m finding in games that offer the choice between good and evil.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hollywood Eye</title><link>https://ggr.com/the-hollywood-eye.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2004 22:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/the-hollywood-eye.html</guid><description>&lt;p>While chowing down on workday lunches I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060391138/qid=1099891783/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-4386696-2656740?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846">The Hollywood Eye&lt;/a>&lt;/em>.

I commend you on the amount of networking you did to get into the company. Id like to get some advice from you or someone you think could help me to figure out how to get from where I am now to designing outstanding video games.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m considering changing careers but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the best way to do it. After graduating a few years ago with a doctorate in clinical psychology, I obtained a faculty position at a major university, where I now work as a clinician and researcher . While I have been successful thus far in my area of study, I have made a decision to pursue a career in game design and development. I have some experience in managing large projects, so I might be able to apply for a project director type of position, but I&amp;rsquo;m most interested the artistic end of game design. I am considering taking a certification course in 3D character design and animation at the university where I currently work. But I dont want to spend the money, or begin transitioning from my current position, if my chances of being able to break into the industry are slim to none. I&amp;rsquo;m sure to be competing with students who have had much more experience in computing and art than I could ever hope to obtain at this point in my life (even though I&amp;rsquo;m only 30). Do you think my training in psychology, and the skills that I have developed as a clinical research scientist will be desired by a game company? What type of additional training would you recommend? How much experience do most new hires (those individuals who are fresh out of college or internship) have in the area of 3D character design? I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if a 9-month intensive course would be sufficient to compete. Are there any jobs that I might be suited for in this industry? Any advice would be very much appreciated.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interships Breakdown</title><link>https://ggr.com/interships-breakdown.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2004 10:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/interships-breakdown.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>James Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a technical assessment since I haven&amp;rsquo;t applied for a position where it would be appropriate. Cant be too much help there. That said, my advice is to get business cards from everyone you interview with (or at least get their contact info if they are not carrying cards). If you get the gig it won&amp;rsquo;t be as useful, but if you dont hit it out of the ballpark on your first attempt youll have a handful of new contacts that will likely give you the time of day if you call them and ask what you could do better next time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming vs Art Production</title><link>https://ggr.com/programming-vs-art-production.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2004 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/programming-vs-art-production.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jeff Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>My Reply:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making games for the Xbox is an expensive endeavor requiring thousands of dollars of equipment and software from Microsoft. And since writing for the PC isnt all that different from writing for the Xbox I would suggest that you focus your efforts on the PC instead. Visual Studio + the DirectX SDK from Microsoft are the programming tools of choice but VS is expensive (DirectX works with VS and is free). You can find freeware tools that are like Visual Studio that will enable you to write games that make use of the free DirectX SDK and I suggest you locate one of those. C++ is the language most games are made with, but if you dont need extensive multimedia support (as you might not with a board game) then you will find Visual Basic a good language to learn with and make your game. There are a number of books available from Amazon that teach how to make video games. You should buy one or check one out from your library.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interview Follow-ups</title><link>https://ggr.com/interview-follow-ups.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2004 21:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/interview-follow-ups.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rudy Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>my name is stephan i am 12 and i have an idea for a game mode on live 2005 it is called become an nba star .it is when you create a player then select his position, home town,school and,statistics, you can create his family members so they can be there on draft day.then what he will wear on draft day and a voice cause he will narate his career and how he feels.then show david stern announcing the last pick of the draft and show him going up getting his cap and shakingf his hand.then teams will start acalling you on your cell phone asking you to play in the summer leage teams during the games scouts from other teams will look at you and at the end of the summer leauge games teams will call you offering contracts.then you will decide what team to accept the contract from. the people would have left callback numbers on your decision.you will start on the bench you only will get a couple of minutes a game.then by about the 3rd game the star player at your position will get hurt at a practice then the coach will aproach you telling your the starter. but whe you are one the bench you can accelorate the time untill you are put on the bench.when you create a player you will be asked to put you complete name bet so it can be said buy the copmmentators a list of names that can be pronounced by the commentators you can press a button to see how the names sound.you also have the option to develope naturally by game or earn points toward an attribute. over the course of years if you become a good player you will be called by endorsers.soon you will be able to design your own clothes,shoes,headbands,etc.once your contrac tis over you will be offered another one or be released.you will also earn a nickname from your most popular teammate based on the way you play.soon you will be able to buy cars houses clothes,etc but at the start you have to pick from the stuff you can afford based on your salary the more money you make the better stuff you can buy.you will eventually you wll be having press confrences.dont worry,you will have time to type in answers to questions they ask you pretty soon you will get to see your self on tv and hear what other coaches and players have to say about you and your game .at the end you will et up a press confrence announcing yoor retirement.the in acouple of year wich will be simulated based on how much money you have left you can buy one of the most domonate teams that have become bad (at this point it would have auto switched to franchise mode).if you could geta chance to give this to to the creator of live 2005 and see if he likes it. (if he likes it and can get all this done and add some stuff to it. you can take all the credit if he doesnt like it you can say you got it from a kid who wants to work at ea when he gets older&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advice For an Intern</title><link>https://ggr.com/advice-for-an-intern.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2004 21:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/advice-for-an-intern.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stefan Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Hi, my name is Justin I. I live in southern part of California. I am only 14
years old but I am serious to pursue this kind of job. I&amp;rsquo;ve made maps for games
like counter-strike , Medal Of Honor, Call Of Duty, and some more. I am
currently working as a mapper for a Half-Life 2 mod called Insects Infestation.
I dont know what its like to work at ea, or if its good pay. Also what college
is fit for this. EA is one of my favorite game brands, I like mostly first
person shooters, like the battlefield series. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for the new one to
come out ;). It would mean very much to me if you can answer my questions.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UCF and Portfolios</title><link>https://ggr.com/ucf-and-portfolios.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2004 12:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/ucf-and-portfolios.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Albert Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>My name is Albert, and I first want to thank you on having a great website. It&amp;rsquo;s very helpful to those who are planning on joining EA and need some advice on what to expect and what is expect of you. I have several questions I need to ask. I would like to know if you have heard any information about EA expanding their office in Orlando, Fl. I am in the process of getting my BA in Computer Animation , and I hear that EA is building an academy at the University of Central Florida. Will the professors be EA employees? What requirements (skills) are needed in order to intern as an animator at EA? When submitting my portfolio what materials would I include? Does one need to have excellent drawing skills to be considered for a 3d animation position. I work full time and I go to school full time, so it is hard to concentrate on both drawing and animation. I usually stick to animation: even though, drawing does give me the vision and perspective to do my animations. How were you able to network with so many people who worked at EA? Did you come in contact with them before or after you joined EA? If you can give me some tips I would greatly appreciate it. I do apologize for the bombardment of questions, but I am very interested in becoming an EA employee.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High School Prep For a Game Career</title><link>https://ggr.com/high-school-prep-for-a-game-career.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2004 22:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/high-school-prep-for-a-game-career.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Merenia Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Don&amp;rsquo;t ya just hate the whole salary negotiation thing!? Lets say there was a &amp;lsquo;manager&amp;rsquo; position being filled by someone with eight years experience in the industry. What kind of salary would be reasonable with which to begin negotiations? I know theres a lot of considerations and probably a huge range; I&amp;rsquo;m just looking for a baseline to get me headed in the right direction.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My Reply:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should talk to recruiters working in the game industry. Since most game recruiters either work, have worked, or compete with EA for talent they would need to keep up-to-date on that sort of information.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Into EA Music</title><link>https://ggr.com/getting-into-ea-music.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2004 14:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/getting-into-ea-music.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ken #1 Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well, it varies depending on what department of IT you work for. Certifications and experience will definitely not hurt you. I know if you want to get in the NT Team (Windows Administration) you will need to have started your MCSE or expect to obtain it if you do get in the team. For the Network Team I&amp;rsquo;m not to sure but I believe that they prefer to have experienced member. Also I think one of the other big things is your motivation for how bad you want it and when you do get how you perform. For the Desktop Team you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have any certs, but you do need customer service skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Living In Redwood</title><link>https://ggr.com/living-in-redwood.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2004 14:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/living-in-redwood.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rite Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>My Reply:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m under the impression that the towns near Redwood City are not geared to single people under 30. The rent doesnt seem too bad$1200/mo for a 1 room apt or $700 for a room in a house. If you can afford a commute you might enjoy living in SF for roughly the same price and 30 minutes x2 each day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EA's Music Process</title><link>https://ggr.com/eas-music-process.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2004 13:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/eas-music-process.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Biggs Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>More questions for Chris! Just wondering which EA studio you work at&amp;ndash;Europe, Maxis, Redwood Shores, Burnaby, Downtown Vancouver, etc. Also, if you dont mind, Id be interested in hearing about how you got into the industry yourself and any advice on the best strategy for getting into EA (networking and connections? internships? sending in countless demos?).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,43181/">Chris&lt;/a> Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In regards to Lindsay&amp;rsquo;s question, I work at the Redwood Shores office here in Redwood City CA. just south of San Francisco. I got into the industry more or less on pure luck. When I graduated from college, I turned down many jobs out here in the film industry at various companies in order to stay with my then Fianc in Fla. Because of this I took a job working in Broadcast design doing animation for TV commercials and News promos and various other TREMENDOUSLY boring thingsI hated it. This was around the beginning of PS1 and I was lucky enough to come across a start up company in Orlando doing games 1st party for sony. I worked on some real crap games there, but luckily enough got a break working on Duke Nukem for 3d realms and Gt interactive. After that the door opened wide for me, and I was recruited to move and work out here for Eidos interactive where I stayed for 4 yearsnot a bad place to work. But things got boring for me there so here I came to EAand I love it here, there is nothing like knowing whatever game you work on will sell at least a million units. AS for a strategy for getting in here, well that is a tough one. EA really doesnt tend to hire a lot of new talent they really like people who have a lot or at least some experience in the industry, and more importantly people who look as though they can grow professionally. Internships are great if you are starting out, but they are not easy to get. Put together your best work and submit it, then cross your fingers. If you do get in, work your ass off, learn all you can, and chances are you stand a good chance of getting a job here. Sending countless demos is not the way to go. In general the same people view the demos all the time so you arent tricking anyone. Anyways I hope this answers your questions and feel free to post as many as you want, I will reply as often as I can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Animator Roles</title><link>https://ggr.com/animator-roles.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2004 14:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/animator-roles.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Thomas Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

I really only see the Tiger Woods Golf one, which is about as good as it gets, but do they offer anymore? Is this a one intern deal? Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My Reply:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internship position I have now did not even exist before I landed itI had the good fortune of meeting the right people who offered to get me in. Keep in mind that there are lots of positions that never get advertised (my guess is less than 20% of positions in the industry are ever made public before they are filled) and some positions that are specifically created for people that have made the right friends and the right impression. You greatly limit your opportunities if you are only going for the positions that are visible through advertisements and web pages a.k.a. non-networking channels. | I&amp;rsquo;ve heard somewhere that 80% of job holders in the US got their job through a connection rather than an advertisement. The game industry places even more of an emphasis on personal connection with people they hireso that number is probably even higher. | That said, so far the only other ones I&amp;rsquo;ve seen advertised at EA have been for unannounced products with EA Partners (they handle projects that are developed by non-EA studios and they are growing fast). As far as I know, production internships are far fewer in number than those for engineering, art, and marketing. One might expect as much, considering there are often 20+ artists/engineers/marketers per production person on a team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QA Interview Post-mortem</title><link>https://ggr.com/qa-interview-post-mortem.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2004 10:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/qa-interview-post-mortem.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>A Reader Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s another rejection QA story to read. I was reading over what Jonathan said about his experience before my interview. I had the same test he did ( I know this because the questions he posted were on my test as well). Heres my idea of what there hiring strategy is for new QA testers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They have about 3 or so hiring periods 1 day a week (1:00, 3:00, 5:00 etc..) They pick the best scores out of each group (even if you pass) they will pick the best 3-5 people out of 20 (or how many people are there) in each group. The test I took was kinda easy. Some of the questions I know I missed, but most I&amp;rsquo;m confident were correct.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Full Sail and Classes For Animators</title><link>https://ggr.com/full-sail-and-classes-for-animators.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2004 14:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/full-sail-and-classes-for-animators.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Kim Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Theres no major that maps well to production. Producers vary widely in their areas of expertise from: former artists to programmers to testers to business people. My boss is a senior producer who used to be in marketing. My executive producer used to manage a business software product line. Another producer I&amp;rsquo;ve met has an MBA from Harvard.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Hi my name is Ian and I am a computer science major at Dakota State University.

I&amp;rsquo;ve started applying for multiple internships for this summer.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Good evening. I currently work as a Senior Process Manager for a top 10 financial institution. In my current role, I am responsible for ensuring that our institution (over 80 million accounts) complies with multiple forms of USA Patriot Act legislation, including Office of Foreign Assets requirements and Bank Secrecy Act requirements. I manage a direct team of four Process Managers and an indirect team of over 20 Operations/Process Managers across our company, including across 6 different geographic locations and multiple business types. This is all well and good, but I am extremely bored of my job. My true passion is playing video games, which I have done since I was old enough to hold a joystick or to stick a cassette tape in a Commodore 64 and type &amp;ldquo;Load, 8, 1&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt that the ideal role in life would be one in which you do what you love and you love what you do. I am not in that role today. While my gaming experience goes only as deep as to have played them for countless years, I do have a number of skills that I believe are applicable to just about any business environment. I am trained and certified as a Green Belt in Six Sigma, which is a process management methodology, possess an associate&amp;rsquo;s degree in Project Management, and bring a wide array of functional skills to the table, including multi-tasking, people management, requirements definition, process analysis, leadership and a strong knowledge of regulations and legal affairs. I am not sure what the right positon would be for someone like me at a gaming company, but I do know that I would be happy with just about any position that let me help an industry I enjoyed rather than one that simply paid the bills. Any ideas on where I should start and whether or not I might find a home at EA Games with a skills et as described above?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Internship Pay</title><link>https://ggr.com/internship-pay.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2004 10:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/internship-pay.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Chereya Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Alright, so, I&amp;rsquo;ll start off with a simple question&amp;ndash;how does one go about getting a job as a software engineer at EA? I hate to come off as arrogant, however, I have learned that this may be the only chance I have&amp;ndash;every person trying to get a job &amp;ldquo;fluffs up&amp;rdquo; their resume, advertising skills they dont really have. Thus, on a resume, I am the same as anyone else, because even though I may be honest about my skills, I look no different on a resume than someone whos fluffed theirs up. I know that EA must get thousands of job applications and resumes on a weekly basis. My question is: how does one get noticed? I think that there are 2 kinds of programmers&amp;ndash;those that do it for the money, and those that were born with the skill. I am the latter. Even when entering college, I already had more programming and software engineering skills than most PROFESSORS (I wont even compare with the students). Again I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to be so arrogant, but I feel it is the only way to set myself apart. So, even though I may be a more talented and skilled software engineer than most 10-20 year veterans, I am immediately labeled as the &amp;ldquo;college newbie&amp;rdquo; who has &amp;ldquo;no software engineering skills&amp;rdquo; and couldnt write robust code if my life depended on it. In fact, I dont blame them for thinking this&amp;ndash;when I see the other students in my class, even those who love to program, I would also put most of them in that category. My question is&amp;ndash;HOW DOES ONE STAND OUT? How can I show EA that I have what it takes, that I can work with their best. If I had to, I would work for them for FREE for a MONTH just to be able to show them this: whatever it takes. I know that having the right networks count, and that I would have no problem getting a job there if my sisters boyfriends dads cousins boyfriend was a senior software engineer. But I truly believe that if only I could show them my skills, show them that I can solve anything they dish out at me with style and robustness, that they would give me a chance&amp;ndash;if only. Any help anyone could give me would be truly appreciated.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transfering To Executive Producer</title><link>https://ggr.com/transfering-to-executive-producer.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2004 11:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/transfering-to-executive-producer.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Chris Writes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

A great deal of my experience is in getting a team of modelers/animators/programmers to create specific simulation systems for the military. In other words, I build very expensive/limited market video games.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Hi Scott, I came across your site while looking at the EA Academy site (actually I was examining the guidelines for loopholes to get in as an intern). I gotta say that it was pretty smart of you to start this site&amp;ndash;talk about a great way to get noticed by the company! Anyways, I recently graduated from Vancouver Film School as an animator. I would love to get a job at EA in animation (whether it be as a mocap operator or clean up artist, etc) but am finding it incredibly difficult. As they say, one of the best ways to get your foot in the door is as an intern, however my school does not qualify for the Coop programs at EA Canada (since it is a private school) and you need to be an American to get into the USA EA Academy. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been trying to submit my demo tape in hopes of landing some sort of interview (I&amp;rsquo;m going again tomorrow!) and even though I do know at least two people who work for EA BlackBox and EA Canada, so far, it hasnt seemed to help much. Anyways, I was just wondering if you had any insight as to breaking into EA as an animator. I noticed your great advice on emailing people with credits on your favorite EA games. Also, do you think it is worth a shot sending my demo to EA Redwood, or EALA even though I am a Canadian citizen (getting a visa to work in the USA is incredibly difficult unless you are some sort of genius!)?

&lt;p>This site exists to encourage and educate future EA employees about the roles and people of EA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started looking into the game industry I couldnt find much guidance about how to make the jump coming from 10 years in another industry. So, I decided I would share my experiences and try to blaze a path for the next person. Much of the blog was written while I was in the middle of figuring out how to find a job with EA. I have since been hired by EA as a producer on an unannounced action-adventure game so the tactics I have used have at least worked once!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emailing Me</title><link>https://ggr.com/emailing-me.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/emailing-me.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks for saying hello! If you have a question for me about getting a job in the game industry go ahead and email me. I&amp;rsquo;ll post your email message and my reply to it so everyone can check it out and participate&amp;ndash;if youre lucky youll get some replies from my colleagues at EA&amp;hellip;they check out these posts on occasion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve answered a bunch of questions and I&amp;rsquo;ve written on a number of topics related to getting into games. Before you email you might want to do a search on the blog to see if the answer is already there, waiting to be discovered. :) The search box is at the bottom right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looks Like EA Canada Is Hiring</title><link>https://ggr.com/looks-like-ea-canada-is-hiring.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2003 10:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/looks-like-ea-canada-is-hiring.html</guid><description>&lt;p>At least, it &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031211064438/http://www.pbase.com/images/24017078.original.jpg">looks like&lt;/a> they are trying to find a few good programmers. &lt;a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII&lt;/a> stupid question, get a stupid ANSI.&lt;/p>

Basically, she feels stuff has a good chance of coming together at EARS shortly and shes still waiting to hear back from the other studios. Weve decided we should touch base one more time this year and then follow up after the holidays.&lt;/p>

He offered to help me land an internship since its the easiest way to get me in the door and give me a chance to prove what I can do. I asked whether I had been out of college too long, but he seemed confident he could hook me up with a position. Sweet. It will give me the chance to learn from the &lt;em>inside&lt;/em> AND it gives me exposure to the people I want to work with. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to hearing back from him! I&amp;rsquo;m going to follow up in a couple weeks if I dont hear from him sooner. I wasnt clear on whether the internship he had in mind started in January or if it recruited in January to start during the summer. Youll know when I know. ;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Growing Pains For The Industry</title><link>https://ggr.com/growing-pains-for-the-industry.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2003 10:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/growing-pains-for-the-industry.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been told by a few people that getting into the game industry these days is a bit trickier than it used to be&amp;ndash;now that its grown into something with some amount of status (where it used to be considered more of a hobby than an industry), a lot of people have taken an interest in working in the industry.

Rachel was out of town when I &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round-number-1.html">met with EAP&lt;/a>, otherwise I would probably have met her then, though I keep hearing her name. Anyway, Lisa has also been in touch with a couple of her Canadian counterparts too; but everyone (outside of Maxis at the moment) is hella busy hiring, so she thinks they will take a couple days to get back to her. So Lisa and I have a followup scheduled next week.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spike Tvs Video Game Awards</title><link>https://ggr.com/spike-tvs-video-game-awards.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2003 17:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/spike-tvs-video-game-awards.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Shawn Kresal sent me this article about Spike TVs video game awards show.

While I wasnt a fit for somewhat &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/first-ea-app-complete.html">structural reasons&lt;/a> I figured there were probably other areas that could use some improvement. We connected this evening and Craig &lt;em>buried&lt;/em> me with help and advice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started the conversation with a quick recap of what I was looking for: how I could have presented myself better and what I should do to be better prepared when I interview with other groups at EA. Craig told me that everyone liked me and a few people had spoken up saying that EA really needs to hire me&amp;ndash;somehow find me a position. :) In the end, he said, EAP isnt equipped to bring someone new to the industry up to speed in the roles they are hiring for right now. But said hed like to do whatever he can to help me get a position at EA and he was instructing HR to see what they could find in Studio.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phone Call With Lisa Bell</title><link>https://ggr.com/phone-call-with-lisa-bell.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2003 15:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/phone-call-with-lisa-bell.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Lisa and I &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/maxis-asst-prod-update-number-2.html">spoke briefly&lt;/a> a couple months ago, before scheduling todays informational interview.

I had emailed DeMar to try and setup a meeting but we hadn&amp;rsquo;t set anything up yet. Turns out Bing put me on his calendar to his surprise. :p Made me feel pretty cool that &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html">Bing&lt;/a> got him here on my behalf, but I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t want to inconvenience DeMar!

&lt;p>We started our conversation with the standard questions about my interest in games, my favorites, etc. and then I started in with some questions of my own. I asked what makes the difference between a good producer and a great producer and he said there were three areas where a great producer excels:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lunch With Bing Gordon</title><link>https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2003 19:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html</guid><description>&lt;p>So the other day I&amp;rsquo;m in 250&amp;hellip; :) After chatting with Tara I headed over to the front desk to let Jenny Turick (&lt;a href="https://ggr.com/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html">Bing&lt;/a>s exec assistant) know I was here. That is, the front desk of &lt;em>death&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Front Desk Puzzle &amp;rsquo; 10 points&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, after about 4 visits, that when the front desk calls someone and tells me that they have confirmed that they know I&amp;rsquo;m in 250 it can actually mean one of a few different things: a) they left a message for someone other than the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, b) they left a message for the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, c) they talked to someone who doesnt know who I am, doesnt care, and is not coming down to see me, d) they talked to the right person and they are actually coming right down. It&amp;rsquo;s like a test to see if you can figure out how to actually be on time to a meeting in that building. ;) On this occasion I started 10 minutes early&amp;ndash;at 5 late I asked the front desk to make certain they had called Jenny and she had actually &lt;em>said&lt;/em> she was coming down. At 10 minutes late I overhear them pick up the phone and apparently tell Jenny that, yes, there was someone down here named Scott Bonds. Heh heh. The moral of the story is that if you have a meeting in 250, call the person you are meeting yourself. Were all gamers here, think of it as the first puzzle for gaining entry into the main dungeon. ;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flyby Chat With Philip Gee</title><link>https://ggr.com/flyby-chat-with-philip-gee.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2003 18:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/flyby-chat-with-philip-gee.html</guid><description>&lt;p>While Tara and I &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-tara-s.html">chatted&lt;/a> away Philip Gee walked by and Tara quickly introduced us. Phil handles college recruiting for EA and Tara wanted to see if he might have some ideas. I&amp;rsquo;ve been out of college too long for his department, nevertheless he offered to fill me in on which teams he knows of that are hiring producers right now and what the calendar looks like. He pointed out that in December, after the big Christmas push in October, a lot of the teams are working on their pilots with a small team of artists and developers. They are getting ready to pitch their new project before they ramp up the entire team in Q1 on the new year. Nevertheless, there are other teams that are entirely new or are otherwise on a different calendar cycle. Good stuff!

I was wandering the area that the geese had marked as their own (at least, I think the dropping saturate sidewalk must be a popular hangout for them) when &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/a-couple-shout-outs.html">Tara&lt;/a> called and we converged on 250 to talk. Tara made sure to introduce me to everyone she could along the path from the front of the building to the cushy chairs, because shes just cool that way. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Swedish Connection</title><link>https://ggr.com/the-swedish-connection.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2003 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/the-swedish-connection.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks ago I heard from Fredrik Thylander (a game designer with &lt;a href="http://dice.se/">Digital I&amp;rsquo;llusions&lt;/a>) who had stumbled across this site and sent me an email just to say he likes the site and good luck. He also put a good word in for &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/first-interview.html">John Vifian&lt;/a> and EAP&amp;ndash;good bunch of guys to work with.

Of course, the graphics are a little dated, but I liked &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/alice-notes.html">Alice&lt;/a> a lot and its getting a little long in the tooth.

I learned a lot and a number of people even offered their business cards and told me to call or email if I had more questions. Thank yous are definitely in order! I was thinking about sending emails, but I decided on personalize hand-written thank you cards. I think cards convey greater appreciation and courtesy because they take more effort. I like to send them promptly too&amp;ndash;I think it better conveys my respect and sincerity when its prompt. So, I just spent an hour writing and addressing cards to each of the 10 people I met. Now I am off to drive them to the post office so that they will begin their journey towards Redwood City first thing Saturday morning. And then some sleep. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In-person Interviews With EAP, Round</title><link>https://ggr.com/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2003 23:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Its been quite a day! 5 hours of interviews stacked back-to-back with a bunch of the EAP team&amp;hellip;and this is just the first round of in-person interviews. These were proceeded by two &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/first-interview.html">phone interviews&lt;/a> a couple weeks ago. It was pretty cool meeting everyone and having the chance to ask a lot of questions about EA and the production roles here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Craig Alexander told me the reason for the high number of interviews was that EA is very consensus oriented&amp;ndash;I will be working with a lot of people very closely under a lot of pressure and it&amp;rsquo;s important that everyone get along really well. It sounds like a good idea to me. And I get 10 more people to ask about EA and learn more of the culture and way or working at my game company of choice. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chat With Ofer Estline</title><link>https://ggr.com/chat-with-ofer-estline.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2003 22:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/chat-with-ofer-estline.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Ofer and I met at EALA after work (well, not really, Ofer planned to stay until midnight) to talk about EA and Development Directors (DDs). First a quick tour of EALA which is presently packed with three studios. Its nice and cozy until January when the new offices come online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I asked Ofer to tell me more about DD vs Producers at EA. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the story from a couple Producers, but Ofer is the first DD I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to sit down with. He explained that the DD role is reserved for those proficient in the art of management&amp;ndash;of people and projects. The DDs does stuff like write up the reviews, assign the tasks, manage the schedules, assign office space, and resolve disputes. They take the vision for the game from the Producer and make it happen. The DD role was split off from the producer and developer roles in order to allow these roles to be focused on design and programming respectively. That way, if you are a whiz programmer you can advance on a career track where you become a guru (technical director) without needing to become a manager and deal with all the new skill areas that such a move requires.

It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the &lt;a href="http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F">company&lt;/a> and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun&amp;ndash;we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world. Jordan was kind enough to make me a copy and I think its worth sharing. Here is the ad published in the September 1983 issue of &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific American&lt;/a>:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Online Networking</title><link>https://ggr.com/online-networking.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2003 16:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/online-networking.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I was recently asked how online networking tools like &lt;a href="http://www.spoke.com/">Spoke&lt;/a> have contributed to my efforts to meet people within the game industry. I signed up for Spoke, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linked-In&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster">Friendster&lt;/a>, and couple others a few months ago. But none of them were much help for meeting people in the game industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Whats Missing?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I havent met many people in the game industry that choose to spend a lot of time on networking&amp;ndash;it sorta happens during the course of working in the industry but the industry is otherwise a bit insulated. It seems that game makers have less of a need for active networking than the practitioners of other entertainment industries. If you are actor, for example, attention is your currency. If you are game programmer or an animator, networking is still important, but an active networking hobby isnt as central to a successful career. There are people who are exceptions to the rule, and I &lt;em>am&lt;/em> operating off very little data so far, but thats the initial look of things to me. Most of the people I talk to tell me they got into the industry through a friend; yet when I asked my friend Auren (who knows half the people in San Francisco) he had trouble naming &lt;em>any&lt;/em> game contacts off the top of his head. The online networking tools didnt do much better&amp;ndash;just not that many game people in there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>6 Hours Of Interviews</title><link>https://ggr.com/6-hours-of-interviews.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2003 13:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/6-hours-of-interviews.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Got the email packet for my EAP interviews this week and I note that its going to be a marathon of 30 to 45 minute interviews. I&amp;rsquo;ll get the chance to meet a lot of the people I would be working with and I&amp;rsquo;ll have an opportunity to meet all the different titles I want to learn more about&amp;ndash;Associate Development Director (DD), Associate Producer (AP), Producer, Senior Producer, VP. Thats some serious interviewing though! I feel like I should run up a hill and eat broccoli the day before or something. :) The gig I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for is an Assistant Producer role with EAP. I saw Scott Evans on the interview list. I &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html">emailed&lt;/a> him a while back about System Shock 2 which he produced. Its going to be pretty cool to meet him in person and to know that I might get to work with someone that made one of the best games ever, IMHO.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>APs and Morrowind</title><link>https://ggr.com/aps-and-morrowind.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2003 21:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/aps-and-morrowind.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Met up with my friend &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1828266/?ref_=fn_al_nm_3">Aaron Butler&lt;/a> for lunch. Hes an Associate Producer with MTV and hes earned credits for editing and directing as well. Hes had some offers from VH1 too&amp;ndash;basically hes totally kicking butt down here. We used to be roommates and before that we were involved in &lt;a href="http://asuc.org/">student government&lt;/a> together at Cal. Aarons been making films for the absolute love of it since he was in junior high&amp;ndash;seeing him doing so well is really cool.

All smile and naps. :) Hes a stay-at-home dad for a few months and he cant do too much&amp;hellip;everything is in 2 hour feed-sleep cycles. He and Amy are big gamers and hes tried to fit in some &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/shadowbane/">Shadowbane&lt;/a>, but its hard to do much but clean the house and watch Jerry Springer.

For one, I timed a bunch of eBay auctions poorly and I&amp;rsquo;m packing them now. It probably doesnt help that I stayed up late opening up Pass 2 in SSX3. I also sent some emails out to contacts at EALA. I dont know if the new studio has opened yet, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it hasnt. Id like to see the old one while I&amp;rsquo;m down there and say hi to some guys I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to a bunch of times. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll hear back from Erin about her friend down there and I just got a really nice email I was CCed on from Neil to the guys he suggested I meet. &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,398866/">Chris Plummer&lt;/a> is in LA and hes the guy that got into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Systems">Origin&lt;/a> using the say hi to everyone you can approach kinda like me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In-person For EAP Scheduled</title><link>https://ggr.com/in-person-for-eap-scheduled.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2003 07:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/in-person-for-eap-scheduled.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I heard from Stephanie of EAP last night&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m scheduled to spend some face-to-face time with the EAP folks next week.

Erin took off for her appearance at Stanford and Jordan sat me down and showed me what he was working on. He helps with the animation on Bond&amp;ndash;he develops some of the custom tools they use and the capabilities are seriously ahead of the pack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves&amp;ndash;and the character moves properly, transitions and all. The animators still have to build all the moves, but the intermediary states arent a problem anymore. On top of that, hes found a way to get the number of key states for the skeletons down dramatically by using this method&amp;ndash;for a substantial memory savings. Really brilliant stuff.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lunch With Erin Turner</title><link>https://ggr.com/lunch-with-erin-turner.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2003 17:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/lunch-with-erin-turner.html</guid><description>&lt;p>After I said &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html">goodbye&lt;/a> to Neil I headed to the lobby of 250. I was a little early so I played some &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/ssx-3">SSX 3&lt;/a> while I waited for &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/reinforcements.html">Erin&lt;/a>. Once she appeared I pried myself off the console and we headed to lunch at the EA cafeteria. My first time there&amp;hellip;man if the cafeterias had been like this at Berkeley. The food was entirely, you know, identifiable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I told her about my meeting with Neil as I wondered what it all meant. She assured me that its all good and that Neil is an ideal guy for me to know at EA. With that we got to talking about the challenges with growing the industry, especially marketing games to females. I brought up a recent lecture by &lt;a href="http://www.tompeters.com/">Tom Peters&lt;/a> where he talks about marketing to women and points out what seems to me a good solution: we need more game companies with boards, EPs, programmers and organizations that look more like the market we want to go after (i.e. more women wherever there arent that many right now). Heh heh, she had heard the broadcast too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sit Down With Neil Young</title><link>https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2003 16:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/sit-down-with-neil-young.html</guid><description>&lt;p>When Neil &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/an-email-from-neil-young.html">offered&lt;/a> to meet with me last week it was sort of like I had written a blog about how I like epic movies and then I got an email from &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/">Peter Jackson&lt;/a> offering to meet with me. Basically, it was really cool :) So I was looking forward to meeting Neil and seeing what it was we would talk about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Who Are You, Who Are Any Of Us?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was no open position we were meeting to talk about&amp;ndash;I was just looking for advice and I was excited to be talking to someone who really knows his stuff. Neil opened by saying he dug my blog and appreciated my interest in EA and thats why he offered to meet me. And then he hit me with the threes (of death): what are your three all-time favorite: games, books, songs, movies?

It reminded me of my consulting team at QuickStart. I dubbed my team BAAD (Bay Area Applications Development) and games were allowed in the office. Heck, half the time &lt;em>I&lt;/em> was on &lt;a href="http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/AWP">AWP&lt;/a> duty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My team handled the applications development for QuickStarts consulting practice in Northern California and I was blessed with a team of outstanding consultants. Not only could they program&amp;ndash;they were communicators who worked well with our customers. While our job was about non-game as you get (writing accounting software, project management software, and walking clients through needs analysis) the office gameplay was a tremendous boon to team cohesiveness and morale.

Liz Wakefield made the whole thing happen and seems like shed be cool to just hang with. I didnt get a chance to speak much with Jennifer Olsen, but Id love to learn more about what its like to be Editor-in-Chief for &lt;em>the&lt;/em> game magazine. And Bill Swartz was a straight to the point, no bullshit, really good insights into production kinda guy. Totally been there, done that and now hes at his own studio.

The meeting centered on a discussion of the newly released whitepaper by the &lt;a href="http://wiki.igda.org/Online_Games_SIG/Steering_Committee">Online Games Committee&lt;/a>. John Welch of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockwave.com">Shockwave.com&lt;/a>, Dave Rohrl of &lt;a href="http://www.pogo.com">EA Online&lt;/a>, Margaret Wallace of &lt;a href="http://www.skunkstudios.com/">Skunk Studios&lt;/a>, and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developer_Magazine">Game Developer Magazine&lt;/a>) moderating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker. I finally met Liz Wakefield in person (after a few emails back and forth)&amp;ndash;she chairs the chapter and serves as the operations manager for the IGDA. I spoke to her at &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/buzz-9-cafe-san-francisco">Buzz9&lt;/a> afterwards and learned that she majored in English and sorta fell into the role through her job at CMP.

She manages the PR for the &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Clancy series&lt;/a> for Ubisoft&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/phone-tag-and-persistence.html">trying&lt;/a> to get a hold of her for a little while. She was out of town on business and vacation, so that explains it. Pretty cool stuff though; she just had a meeting with MTV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tiffany noted that the Ubisoft office in SF is in fact a marketing office; though it is also home to a number of Ubisoft producers who manage relationships with their local studio partners (sorta like the role at EAP I&amp;rsquo;m interviewing for). MS, Nintendo, Sony, Activision, and Ubisoft are all important players she says, though she thinks they are a little bureaucratic (as they have to be since they are so large). Sierra and Maxis are smaller and better for starting out she thinks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Interview</title><link>https://ggr.com/first-interview.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2003 22:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/first-interview.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I had my first interview with EA today. John Vifian gave me a call at the &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/and-on-the-eap-front.html">appointed time&lt;/a> and we talked about the job of Development Director (DD) at EA Partners (EAP). It was fun talking to him&amp;ndash;he has some great experience in the industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Development Director&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DDs report to Exec Producers who report to Tom Frisina. As I understand it, DDs at EAP represent the publishers (EA&amp;rsquo;s) interests on a project by helping guide the studio EA has a partnership with; ideally to help them take a successful game and turn it into a successful franchise. That involves the omnipresent budget, schedule, and product/quality &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1556159005/ref=sib_vae_pg_4/104-7998853-1870303?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=triangle&amp;amp;p=S045&amp;amp;twc=8&amp;amp;checkSum=liEp6n4LqpAGxqgPYRnlD61L72TBrBNPnW1T5JKzZmo%3D#reader-link">balancing act&lt;/a> for which the DD is ultimately responsible. It sounds a lot like a publisher-side Producer role as I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them at other publishers. The DD at Maxis is a bit heavier on the technical side of things and is internal to the studio, so EAPs DD seems a little different. I think I recall John mentioning that the role is somewhat new for EAP, but I&amp;rsquo;m not certain if I remember that correctly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maxis Asst Prod, Update</title><link>https://ggr.com/maxis-asst-prod-update.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2003 13:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/maxis-asst-prod-update.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Just got off the phone with Lisa Bell.

I did think it a bit odd that the only credit I could find for her was a &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; on the Sims Online. Heh. Hopefully shell realize what a catch I am ;)I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can convince her by giving her a phone call or two. I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if I should just take a stab at who the hiring manager might be and email some of the producers on the credits for the other SimCity games&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dinner With the QS Gang</title><link>https://ggr.com/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2003 22:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Just got back from dinner with some friends from my days at QuickStart, one of which is was Matthew Chamberlain of Microsoft. He reports that hes still on the hunt at MS on my behalf (which is, of course, awfully nice of him). We got together a couple weeks ago at the MS SF office to search for people to talk to. We decided it would be a good idea to start with a couple of guys at the top (it goes something like: guys at the top-&amp;gt;studio heads-&amp;gt;exec producers-&amp;gt;producers-&amp;gt;associate producers) and go from there. He tells me hes helping because he cares about his MS stock price. Indeed. Heh heh. He also reminded me that he can hook me up with any &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/company/microsoft-studios">MS published&lt;/a> games at a big discount. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phone Tag and Persistence</title><link>https://ggr.com/phone-tag-and-persistence.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2003 10:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/phone-tag-and-persistence.html</guid><description>&lt;p>My friend Auren emailed me an introduction to Tiffany Spencer who is a PR Manager (as best I can tellshe works out of SF and Ubisofts SF office is a &lt;a href="https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/about_ubisoft/world_presence/biz_northamerica.aspx">marketing office&lt;/a>) for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft">Ubisoft&lt;/a>. She emailed me once last week but I havent been able to reach her since. Perhaps shes out of town or very busy. I am reminded of how many times I have had to contact a person 10 times or more before I finally got a hold of them. And most times it totally paid off. The reasons why people take a while can be all over the map, it pays not to take it personally and just realize that there are probably some perfectly good reasonsand in any case, it&amp;rsquo;s usually worth the wait.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Movable Type Spam</title><link>https://ggr.com/first-movable-type-spam.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2003 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/first-movable-type-spam.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/03/10/27/1739206/spam-rapidly-increasing-in-weblog-comments">It &lt;/a>was bound to happen.

I thought Id check out EA&amp;rsquo;s filing in June and see what I could learn about the company. Its always a great way to see where the money really is and where the company is headed, generally speaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I&amp;rsquo;ve gleaned a few interesting tidbits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The new EALA is going to be pretty important. EA is consolidating the old LA, Irvine, and Vegas studios into it, at substantial expense.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Publishing and distribution of 3rd party games has doubled in the last year, making it an important growth area for EA.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PS/2 revenues went down quite a bit in the last year, while PC went up slightly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>EA still makes most of its money from PS/2 but PC is a solid second.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The US went up a healthy amount last year, but Europe was pretty flat. The US and Europe are the big markets for EA. Asia is small, but the combined total for the rest of the world as a whole is not to shabby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>EA loaned $4m to its EVP when they hired him last year. Awfully good sport of them. ;)&lt;/li>

On the one hand, I&amp;rsquo;m a fairly confident guy, but on the other hand, I dont really like tooting my own horn. Cant be too bold or too humble and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta speak the right language. There are certain things I need to communicate to get past the gatekeepers and make it all the way to the hiring manager and &lt;em>then&lt;/em> land an interview.

Yah, shes probably not the hiring manager, but hopefully shell be nice enough to forward it to them&amp;hellip;I also sent an email to &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/the-maxis-tour.html">Toby&lt;/a> asking if he might know who over there is the hiring manager so I can address my interest to the right person. I feel its better to address a letter to a specific person rather than a generic one, wherever possible.

I also asked why Moby wasnt showing him on Alice in their DB and it turns out the person who put the data in originally missed him. So, I contacted Moby and got them to &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,3/gameId,2703/">add his credit&lt;/a> as the executive producer on the project. But he did a lot more than exec produce the game&amp;ndash;he wrote the script and the dialogue while directing the voice and music. I bet he had a blast! I&amp;rsquo;m envious. :) Funny thing is, Jordan Maynard who I &lt;a href="https://ggr.com/reinforcements.html">just met&lt;/a> through Erin Turner is the son of David Maynard, a cofounder of EA.

Heck, I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to the &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,63361/">producer&lt;/a> and a bunch of friends have recommended the game. Took me about 20 hours to play through. The graphics were funthey set the mood of wandering through this land of dark imagination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Excellent Interface&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The music was good. The menus were excellent, starting with the startup sequence with the EA logo turning into the Cat, accompanied by light laughter turning into twisted laughter. The lighting effects and the candle in the main menu help set the tone, and the other menus were great too. These interface details are often shortchanged in games, but Alice puts them to use setting the mood, with great effect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First IGDA Chapter Meeting Soon</title><link>https://ggr.com/first-igda-chapter-meeting-soon.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2003 19:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/first-igda-chapter-meeting-soon.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Got an email a little while ago.

After looking at the limited level of Internet chatter related to the game these day, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think there arent that many people playing Mage. So sad.

Some of these plot-driven &lt;a href="http://www.planettribes.com/allyourbase/AYB2.swf">games&lt;/a> have rather pitiful plots, i.e. Earth is being invaded by aliens and you, the last super badass are all that stands in the way of total destruction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Future of IWantToWorkAtEA.com</title><link>https://ggr.com/the-future-of-iwanttoworkatea.com.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2003 04:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/the-future-of-iwanttoworkatea.com.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I was thinking the other day about what should happen to this domain once I land a gig at EA.

Theyve got their own Sims skins5 too. :) That evening, after the evening of ear blasting and all things black, I stumbled across a little gem known as 411 publishing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>System Shock 3</title><link>https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2003 12:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/system-shock-3.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Like &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> else in the game industry, I too have a pet game idea or two. Having read most of the production articles at &lt;a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/category/production/">Gamasutra&lt;/a> and much of &lt;a href="http://www.sloperama.com/advice.html">Sloperama&lt;/a> I realize that like most software and unlike Athena, games do not spring forth from your head fully formed. So a few weeks ago I started looking into just what it would take to build a game myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Start With an Idea, Add Salt&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beer At Jupiters</title><link>https://ggr.com/beer-at-jupiters.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2003 23:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/beer-at-jupiters.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Tonight I decided to grab a beer at &lt;a href="http://www.jupiterbeer.com/">Jupiters&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=84317/">Michael Constant&lt;/a>. He left Activision a little while ago to work on a math degree at &lt;a href="http://berkeley.edu/">Berkeley&lt;/a> (my alma mater). I met Michael when my friend Melinda brought him to a movie night a couple weeks ago. You worked in gaming you say? We really must talk some more. :) Turns out Michaels a real badass. Hes been mentoring new developers and taking on the bitch ass bugs that no one else has the guts to stare down.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EA's Biz Side</title><link>https://ggr.com/eas-biz-side.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2003 10:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/eas-biz-side.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Thought I would start the week by giving Joel Lizner of EA a call. I was introduced to him through my friend &lt;a href="http://www.coblentzlaw.com/our-people/jonathan-r-bass/">Jon Bass&lt;/a>. I never would have guessed he knew people in the industry, but hes introduced me to Joel and to &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,63361/">RJ Berg&lt;/a>, a producer over at LucasArts. It just goes to show that when you are looking to meet people in the industry, tell &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> you can. You never know who all your friends of friends know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IGDA And The Good Life</title><link>https://ggr.com/igda-and-the-good-life.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2003 22:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/igda-and-the-good-life.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I joined the &lt;a href="http://igda.org/">IGDA&lt;/a>s committee on &lt;a href="http://wiki.igda.org/Quality_of_Life_SIG">quality of life&lt;/a> a few weeks ago, offering to bring the newbie perspective to the table. Weve been asked to produce a white paper overviewing the state of the industry from a QoL point of view, to be unveiled at GDC 2004. The whole thing has been pretty illuminating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m getting a health dose of reality from people who have come together to air the industrys dirty laundryall manner of things from unionization to reasons people leave the industry have come up. The industry is suffering from growing pains as well as the popularity that comes with being successful in a down economy. And besides those topics, the cowboy history of the whole thing has combined with the Hollywood, software development, and publishing aspects of the industry to form what we have today. It certainly hasnt turned me off to the industry, but its good to know just what I&amp;rsquo;m diving into. ;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Campaign Begins</title><link>https://ggr.com/the-campaign-begins.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2003 23:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/the-campaign-begins.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Just got back from a fundraiser my friend put on for &lt;a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2003/11/04/ca/sf/meas/H/">Prop H&lt;/a> in San Francisco. Ammiano was funny and the vegetable dip was top rate. My friend Mel is threatening to find a way to get &lt;a href="http://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video22637">Georgy&lt;/a> to my next &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/infoimaging/free_forbes/2003/0512/127.html">movie night&lt;/a> because I said that she is cute. But I&amp;rsquo;ve got my own campaign to think about. My campaign to land a gig with &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/locations/redwood-shores">EA in Redwood City&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I want to work for EA. I thought I just wanted to work in the game industry, but I visited EA in Redwood last week and I was blown away. Rob Moreno, a recruiter there is a friend of a friend and he offered to show me around even though he recruits corporate and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in game production. I just had a great time. EA&amp;rsquo;s got a great campus and Rob really sold me on what a great place EA would be to work. It was already at the top of my list, but after meeting with him I decided to take it up a notch and begin my campaign to work at EA.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Copyright This</title><link>https://ggr.com/copyright-this.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 1997 13:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ggr.com/copyright-this.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I decided to copyright my DNA (TM). I mentioned this to my parents, and they
produced a copy of the End User License Agreement (EULA) that I signed for my
DNA when I was just a few seconds old, and complained of numerous violations
(they still claim to be the original authors, with all visible evidence to the
contrary). But, reading legal newsgroups has kept me abreast of the latest, and
I knew that a contract with a minor is non-binding. Besides, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even
look like my digital signature. Nevertheless, they sued me for the copyrights
my DNA and for the emotional trauma caused by my alleged abuse of their DNA
during my alleged childhood, in what appeared to be a clear alleged violation
of our alleged agreement.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
