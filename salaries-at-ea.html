Lets say there was a &lsquo;manager&rsquo; position being filled by someone with eight years experience in the industry. What kind of salary would be reasonable with which to begin negotiations? I know theres a lot of considerations and probably a huge range; I&rsquo;m just looking for a baseline to get me headed in the right direction.</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>You should talk to recruiters working in the game industry. Since most game recruiters either work, have worked, or compete with EA for talent they would need to keep up-to-date on that sort of information.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Kat&rsquo;s email, I figure she doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
