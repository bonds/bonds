<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>While I was visiting <a href=/bond-and-jordan-maynard.html>Jordan Maynard</a> last week, I noticed an old EA advertisement framed on his desk. It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the <a href=http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F>company</a> and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun&ndash;we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world. Jordan was kind enough to make me a copy and I think its worth sharing.
