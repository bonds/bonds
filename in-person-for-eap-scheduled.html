<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>I heard from Stephanie of EAP last night&ndash;I&rsquo;m scheduled to spend some face-to-face time with the EAP folks next week. I got a chance to meet John and Craig <a href=/a-fond-adieu.html>briefly</a>, but this is the real deal. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to sitting down with them and some of the EAP team and getting a better feel for how EAP works! <em>And</em> asking more questions from my unending font of questions about game production and the industry. Stephanie tells me an email with the official application and NDA will be in my box shortly. I dont want to get too excited yet, but its great to have made it that much closer!</p></div></body></html>
