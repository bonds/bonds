<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>After <a href=/lunch-with-erin-turner.html>lunch</a> Erin and I walked over to say hi to <a href=/reinforcements.html>Jordan Maynard</a>. Erin took off for her appearance at Stanford and Jordan sat me down and showed me what he was working on. He helps with the animation on Bond&ndash;he develops some of the custom tools they use and the capabilities are seriously ahead of the pack.</p><p>As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves&ndash;and the character moves properly, transitions and all. The animators still have to build all the moves, but the intermediary states arent a problem anymore. On top of that, hes found a way to get the number of key states for the skeletons down dramatically by using this method&ndash;for a substantial memory savings. Really brilliant stuff.</p><p>Jordan showed me some of the gameplay and it looks great. Bond can do all manner of badass stuff. I especially like how they handle aiming&ndash;I&rsquo;ve always found aiming on a console to be frustrating compared to using a mouse on a PC. Bond aims for you, but leaves you with enough control and other gaming elements that you dont miss it at all. I looks like it allows you to focus on doing badass Bond moves and enjoying the plot of the game instead. Sweet.</p><p>I still cant quite get over what a great vibe I get from everybody I&rsquo;m meeting. Jordan is cool. Erin is cool. Neil is cool. I mean, not only are they talented, theyre the kind of people I would totally hangout with <em>and</em> the kind I would like to work with (up to this point, I haven&rsquo;t been able to say <em>both</em> about too many people). I dont know if I&rsquo;m just getting really lucky with the people I&rsquo;m meeting so far or what, but its quite a pattern.</p><p>Before I took off Jordan showed me the EA manifesto from the mid-80s (or around then). I&rsquo;m going to ask him to email me a copy, it looks really cool. It asks if a computer can make you cry&ndash;I think it means in a good way. ;) And I think thats the right question.</p></div></body></html>
