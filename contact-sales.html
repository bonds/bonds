<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/misc.html>#misc</a></div><p><img src=/images/contact-sales.jpg alt="a salesperson paywall"></p><p>These days it seems that a lot of SaaS tools are offering a free tier, one or
more paid tiers, and an &rsquo;enterprise&rsquo; tier, which, unlike the other tiers, has
amazing new capabilities but no price. Or rather, the price is &lsquo;contact sales&rsquo;.</p><p>That price is too high for me. I don&rsquo;t want to contact sales. I don&rsquo;t want to
waste time listening to a pitch, hearing the retail price, hearing what a great
deal they&rsquo;re willing to offer me off the retail price because I&rsquo;m special and
there&rsquo;s a blue moon tonight. I don&rsquo;t want to email a bunch of my friends and
scour forums digging for the <em>real</em> pricing scale, to make sure I&rsquo;m not getting
ripped off. I don&rsquo;t want a multiyear contract that keeps me paying for a service
even if its no longer right for me.</p><p>The day I need the &lsquo;contact sales&rsquo; tier is the day that I look hard for
alternatives with public, pay-as-you-go pricing.</p></div></body></html>
