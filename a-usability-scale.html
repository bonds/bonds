But there&rsquo;s more to usability than an intuitive interface. The best stuff in our lives are pleasant, fun, even habit forming.</p><p><strong>The Scott Bonds Usability Scale</strong></p><ol><li>Unusable. Not useful or usable in any sense.</li><li>Functional. Very useful, but requires instruction (manual, training, demo, etc) before a desired feature is understood.</li><li>Usable. Intuitive, requires little instruction before the user is proficient.</li><li>Pleasant. Using it is satisfying and enjoyable.</li><li>Fun. Use it for its own sake, possibly independent of its core &lsquo;function&rsquo;.</li><li>Addictive. So fun its difficulty to give up its regular use.</li></ol><p>Products that achieve scores above a 2, beyond &lsquo;mere&rsquo; usability (which is itself tremendously hard to achieve), tend to enjoy more success than their competition. There are some <a href=http://www.upassoc.org/usability_resources/conference/2004/UPA-2004-TullisStetson.pdf>other usability scales</a> available as well as good advice about how to <a href=http://www.sensible.com/secondedition/index.html>gather feedback</a> to assess where your project lands on this scale.</p></div></body></html>
