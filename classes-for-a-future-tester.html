Testers are often picked (to the best of my knowledge) for there ability and familiarity with games.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Ian&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
