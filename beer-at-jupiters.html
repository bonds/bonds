<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Tonight I decided to grab a beer at <a href=http://www.jupiterbeer.com/>Jupiters</a> with <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=84317/">Michael Constant</a>. He left Activision a little while ago to work on a math degree at <a href=http://berkeley.edu/>Berkeley</a> (my alma mater). I met Michael when my friend Melinda brought him to a movie night a couple weeks ago. You worked in gaming you say? We really must talk some more. :) Turns out Michaels a real badass. Hes been mentoring new developers and taking on the bitch ass bugs that no one else has the guts to stare down.</p><p>It was fun talking about the details of PS2 codingthe trade offs because the memory bus is slow, but with 128-bit integers and a fast render it makes more sense to calculate and render everything you can rather than sorting by z-buffer and caching other stuff. But, you still have to do clipping because if you go outside the screen past 30 pixels you hose memory. I forgot how much fun it is to talk to hardcore developers. :) I havent been bumping into people on the street who know assembly and its fun to stretch those muscles!</p><p>Michael gave me a tidbit to pass on to another friend at EA, Erin Turner. Hes figured out the hacks needed to network boot GC and PS2 (easier than GC) that I think Erin may have been looking for, I&rsquo;ll shoot her a quick email. He hasnt seen the EA campus yet, I gotta remember to invite him next time I&rsquo;m down there.</p></div></body></html>
