One of her favorite ways to show us she cared was to cook us food&mldr;
and to sneak us a cookie when mom wasn&rsquo;t looking.
My great-grandma (who we called Abuelita), grandma, mother, brother,
and I have all made this bread and it&rsquo;s really good.</p><p>Especially with a little warm butter spread on top.
The recipe has been passed down through my family for generations
and with each generation it&rsquo;s become infused with a little more love. :)</p><p><em>Updated on July 14, 2022</em></p><ul><li>Moved the story after the recipe.
