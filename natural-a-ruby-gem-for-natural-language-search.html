<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/code.html>#code</a></div><p><img src=https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/natural_on_github.png alt=6></p><p>When I started work on <a href=http://dishfu.com>DishFu.com</a> (one of my code playgrounds&mldr;its
something like Yelp) a couple years ago I wanted to support natural
language search so that, instead of clicking lots of checkboxes to
search for the best burrito in my zip code, I could just ask &ldquo;what is
the best burrito near me&rdquo; and get the answer. At the time (and even now)
I didn&rsquo;t find a ruby library that made this easy to do, so I thought I&rsquo;d
take a stab at it.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/bonds/natural>Natural</a> is the result of the aforementioned stab and its available
on github. Checkout <a href=http://flexibits.com/>Fantastical</a> and <a href=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html>Siri</a> for inspiration and
two good examples of why natural language search is neat and how it
enhances usability. Natural works by parsing the input text, looking for
every possible match in its vocabulary, scoring all the possible
combinations of matches, and choosing the highest scoring combination.
One can achieve a similar effect (and faster) by enumerating a bunch of
regular expressions and trying to match against the most complicated
regular expression first and working your way down until you find a
match, but I wanted a library that could also glean partial meanings and
choose between different potential matches in a more flexible way.
