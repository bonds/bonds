<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/politics.html>#politics</a></div><p>Amazon used to have outstanding customer support. But it seems their focus is elsewhere these days. In the past I&rsquo;d contact them via phone or email and someone would try to understand my issue and resolve it in my favor. But yesterday I had a phone+email exchange about a very late order that they struggled to understand and chose not to fix&ndash;it seemed it wasn&rsquo;t a fit for their playbook, so they couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to do except to tell me I&rsquo;m out of luck. The fix would have been easy for an empowered, quality CS rep to handle, but that&rsquo;s not what I got.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been a customer since 1999 and I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of money (millions) with the for my family and my companies. But I guess folks like me aren&rsquo;t worth the trouble anymore.</p><p>Oh well, nothing lasts forever. I haven&rsquo;t been super happy with their poor management of counterfeit merchandise, review quality, higher pricing&mldr;this is a good excuse to get off my butt and take a good look at the alternatives.</p></div></body></html>
