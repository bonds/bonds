I could take a computer game design/programming class that will mostly focus on the implementation process or take classes that revolve around operations management and business classes.</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen all of those skills are useful to a producer, though I think you would have easier time getting a job in todays industry with programming training than with business training.</p><p>Producers have to form a clear vision of the excellent, profitable game they want to build and then they have to have the leadership and technical skills to coach a diverse team of people (including their supervisors) to build the game and make the needed tradeoffs and improvements along the way. I have yet to meet two producers with the same backgrounds&mldr;there are a lot of paths to becoming a producer, though its not a fit for the interests and abilities of everyone. But that is a different discussion.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Koz&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
