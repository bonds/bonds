<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/code.html>#code</a></div><p>I looked around for an easier way to post an <strong>internal</strong> IP to DynDNS,
but I didn&rsquo;t find one. Scripting to the rescue.</p><p>If you have a paid account at DynDNS (may work for free ones too, I&rsquo;m
not sure), you can update a DNS entry by hitting a URL like this:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>So, to update your DNS entry, you just need to <a href=/how-to-get-your-ip-and-only-your-ip-in-windows.html>get your IP alone in a
variable</a> that a batch file can use, then setup a task to request
that URL every so often. In more detail, the steps are:</p><ol><li>Install Cygwin including the &lsquo;curl&rsquo; package. Curl allows you to make
web requests from the command line.</li><li>Create a batch file that gets your IP then makes the DynDNS update
request (see below).</li><li>Create a new scheduled task through the Windows Control Panel: setup
multiple schedules so it runs the batch file you created in step #2 at
startup, login, and when the machine is idle 60 minutes.</li></ol><p>The batch file is like so, be sure to update the curl location, DynDNS
login, password, and hostname info before you use it:</p></div></body></html>
