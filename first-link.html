<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>I thought Id Google this sitesee if it was in the search engine already. I was surprised to find a link from another blogger! Pretty cool. Wonder how he heard about the site? So far I&rsquo;ve told so few people about itmy main avenue of exposure so far is through people who I email from the domain. They sometimes notice the address. I also &lsquo;ping&rsquo; a couple blog portals to let them know I&rsquo;ve posted something. I&rsquo;m going to go email this guy and ask him. Come to think of it, I probably should start thinking about raising the sites profile now that I&rsquo;ve got some material up.</p><p><em>Updated on October 4th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the dead link to a blog now long gone.</p></div></body></html>
