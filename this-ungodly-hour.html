<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>So I got up at 6a this morning to take care of some stuff before flying down to LA. For one, I timed a bunch of eBay auctions poorly and I&rsquo;m packing them now. It probably doesnt help that I stayed up late opening up Pass 2 in SSX3. I also sent some emails out to contacts at EALA. I dont know if the new studio has opened yet, I&rsquo;m guessing it hasnt. Id like to see the old one while I&rsquo;m down there and say hi to some guys I&rsquo;ve talked to a bunch of times. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll hear back from Erin about her friend down there and I just got a really nice email I was CCed on from Neil to the guys he suggested I meet. <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,398866/>Chris Plummer</a> is in LA and hes the guy that got into <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Systems>Origin</a> using the say hi to everyone you can approach kinda like me.</p><p><em>Updated on October 6th, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
