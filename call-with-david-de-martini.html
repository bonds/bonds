<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>I had the chance to speak to <a href=/a-quick-hello-with-david-de-martini.html>David De Martini</a> today and tell him my story. He offered to help me land an internship since its the easiest way to get me in the door and give me a chance to prove what I can do. I asked whether I had been out of college too long, but he seemed confident he could hook me up with a position. Sweet. It will give me the chance to learn from the <em>inside</em> AND it gives me exposure to the people I want to work with. I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing back from him! I&rsquo;m going to follow up in a couple weeks if I dont hear from him sooner. I wasnt clear on whether the internship he had in mind started in January or if it recruited in January to start during the summer. Youll know when I know. ;)</p></div></body></html>
