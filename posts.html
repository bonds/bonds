I got to Tiburon around 3:40pm. My interview wasnt until 4pm, so that was good. I would have been there even earlier, but we had a little trouble finding the place. Good thing we left early!
So I walked into Tiburon, very cool building. I saw some arcade machines and stuff in this one room, it must have been the game room. I then found where I needed to go, told them I was there for the interview, and they gave me an application to fill out.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/online-game-classes.html>Online Game Classes</a></h3><a class=summary href=/online-game-classes.html><p>Brian Donoho tells me that Gameversity is offering online courses for aspiring game programmers, including a few free 2-week seminars to try and get you hooked. :) Kinda cool

The Front Desk Puzzle &rsquo; 10 points
I&rsquo;ve noticed, after about 4 visits, that when the front desk calls someone and tells me that they have confirmed that they know I&rsquo;m in 250 it can actually mean one of a few different things: a) they left a message for someone other than the person I&rsquo;m supposed to meet with, b) they left a message for the person I&rsquo;m supposed to meet with, c) they talked to someone who doesnt know who I am, doesnt care, and is not coming down to see me, d) they talked to the right person and they are actually coming right down.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/flyby-chat-with-philip-gee.html>Flyby Chat With Philip Gee</a></h3><a class=summary href=/flyby-chat-with-philip-gee.html><p>While Tara and I chatted away Philip Gee walked by and Tara quickly introduced us.

These were proceeded by two phone interviews a couple weeks ago. It was pretty cool meeting everyone and having the chance to ask a lot of questions about EA and the production roles here.

It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the company and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun&ndash;we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/online-networking.html>Online Networking</a></h3><a class=summary href=/online-networking.html><p>I was recently asked how online networking tools like Spoke have contributed to my efforts to meet people within the game industry.

All smile and naps. :) Hes a stay-at-home dad for a few months and he cant do too much&mldr;everything is in 2 hour feed-sleep cycles. He and Amy are big gamers and hes tried to fit in some Shadowbane, but its hard to do much but clean the house and watch Jerry Springer.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/this-ungodly-hour.html>This Ungodly Hour</a></h3><a class=summary href=/this-ungodly-hour.html><p>So I got up at 6a this morning to take care of some stuff before flying down to LA. For one, I timed a bunch of eBay auctions poorly and I&rsquo;m packing them now. It probably doesnt help that I stayed up late opening up Pass 2 in SSX3. I also sent some emails out to contacts at EALA. I dont know if the new studio has opened yet, I&rsquo;m guessing it hasnt.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/in-person-for-eap-scheduled.html>In-person For EAP Scheduled</a></h3><a class=summary href=/in-person-for-eap-scheduled.html><p>I heard from Stephanie of EAP last night&ndash;I&rsquo;m scheduled to spend some face-to-face time with the EAP folks next week. I got a chance to meet John and Craig briefly, but this is the real deal. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to sitting down with them and some of the EAP team and getting a better feel for how EAP works! And asking more questions from my unending font of questions about game production and the industry.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/a-fond-adieu.html>A Fond Adieu</a></h3><a class=summary href=/a-fond-adieu.html><p>Before I took off I stopped by to say hi to John Vifian and Craig Alexander to put a face with the name. I noticed that John had a wireless Logitech joystick&ndash;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting one. But he says it sucks. Except when you plug it into someone elses machine, program the fire button to emulate the keypress of &rsquo;e&rsquo; and then wait for your, uh, &lsquo;friend&rsquo; to fly a plane while playing Battlefield: 1942.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/bond-and-jordan-maynard.html>Bond and Jordan Maynard</a></h3><a class=summary href=/bond-and-jordan-maynard.html><p>After lunch Erin and I walked over to say hi to Jordan Maynard. Erin took off for her appearance at Stanford and Jordan sat me down and showed me what he was working on. He helps with the animation on Bond&ndash;he develops some of the custom tools they use and the capabilities are seriously ahead of the pack.
As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves&ndash;and the character moves properly, transitions and all.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/lunch-with-erin-turner.html>Lunch With Erin Turner</a></h3><a class=summary href=/lunch-with-erin-turner.html><p>After I said goodbye to Neil I headed to the lobby of 250. I was a little early so I played some SSX 3 while I waited for Erin. Once she appeared I pried myself off the console and we headed to lunch at the EA cafeteria. My first time there&mldr;man if the cafeterias had been like this at Berkeley. The food was entirely, you know, identifiable.
I told her about my meeting with Neil as I wondered what it all meant.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html>Sit Down With Neil Young</a></h3><a class=summary href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html><p>When Neil offered to meet with me last week it was sort of like I had written a blog about how I like epic movies and then I got an email from Peter Jackson offering to meet with me. Basically, it was really cool :) So I was looking forward to meeting Neil and seeing what it was we would talk about.
Who Are You, Who Are Any Of Us?</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/a-day-at-ears.html>A Day at EARS</a></h3><a class=summary href=/a-day-at-ears.html><p>On the schedule for today was a meeting with Neil Young, lunch with Erin Turner, and quick hellos with Jordan Maynard and John Vifian. I was hoping to get in touch with Rob Moreno and [Tara S.][1] as well, but I&rsquo;ll have to catch them next time. I just got back and I&rsquo;ve been smiling like a goofball most of the day. It was a lot of fun talking with everyone and I really dig the vibe I get when I&rsquo;m at EA.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/an-email-from-neil-young.html>An Email From Neil Young</a></h3><a class=summary href=/an-email-from-neil-young.html><p>Thursday I got an email, out of the blue, from Neil Young. Hes a very experienced Executive Producer at EA, judging from his rap sheet. He said he saw this web site and he offered to meet with me. I called his assistant and we set a time to meet this coming Wednesday. Totally made my day. :) I&rsquo;m going to get in touch with Erin Turner, Jordan Maynard, and John Vifian and see if theyll be around so I can stop by and say hi while I&rsquo;m at EARS.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html>On the Phone With Craig Alexander</a></h3><a class=summary href=/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html><p>Just got back from the gym when I noticed Craig Alexander had left a message. John had told me he was the next person I would talk to at EAP, but I didnt know when I would hear from him. I guess today. :) I just missed him by about 15 minutes so I called back and we started things off with me offering a little background on myself.

I only managed a single Guinness on the IGDA tab before we were talking shop. As you may recall, Nonsequiter is a small group of game newbies that has been getting together with the intention of sharing our experiences in the game biz, and more importantly, to make some games.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/baad-and-games-at-work.html>BAAD and Games At Work</a></h3><a class=summary href=/baad-and-games-at-work.html><p>Just came across an article about how games may improve productivity at work. It reminded me of my consulting team at QuickStart. I dubbed my team BAAD (Bay Area Applications Development) and games were allowed in the office. Heck, half the time I was on AWP duty.
My team handled the applications development for QuickStarts consulting practice in Northern California and I was blessed with a team of outstanding consultants. Not only could they program&ndash;they were communicators who worked well with our customers.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/emails-awaaay.html>Emails Awaaay</a></h3><a class=summary href=/emails-awaaay.html><p>At Wednesdays IGDA meeting I met a few cool people that I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll get a chance to stay in touch with. I usually like to follow up with an email within 24 hours, but I&rsquo;m pushing about 26 here. ;) Dave Rohrl was an outstanding speaker and he seemed to me the bottomless pit of game industry wisdom and friendly wit. Liz Wakefield made the whole thing happen and seems like shed be cool to just hang with.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/a-couple-shout-outs.html>A Couple Shout-outs</a></h3><a class=summary href=/a-couple-shout-outs.html><p>Thank you Russell Borogove for the email with encouraging words and some very helpful insights into what its like at EA. Congratulations to my good friend Mark Schlosberg who, after working his butt off for the past months as head of the campaign, won on Prop H in SF. Good to hear from you Tara S.! I&rsquo;m looking forward to grabbing a beer and swapping notes on the industry as soon as we find a chance.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/igda-sf-meeting.html>IGDA SF Meeting</a></h3><a class=summary href=/igda-sf-meeting.html><p>I attended my first IGDA SF meeting last night at the Art Institute (I have a friend that works there too). The meeting centered on a discussion of the newly released whitepaper by the Online Games Committee. John Welch of Shockwave.com, Dave Rohrl of EA Online, Margaret Wallace of Skunk Studios, and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of Game Developer Magazine) moderating.
I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/conversation-with-tiffany.html>Conversation With Tiffany</a></h3><a class=summary href=/conversation-with-tiffany.html><p>Just spoke with Tiffany Spencer of Ubisoft. She manages the PR for the Clancy series for Ubisoft&mldr;I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a hold of her for a little while. She was out of town on business and vacation, so that explains it. Pretty cool stuff though; she just had a meeting with MTV.
Tiffany noted that the Ubisoft office in SF is in fact a marketing office; though it is also home to a number of Ubisoft producers who manage relationships with their local studio partners (sorta like the role at EAP I&rsquo;m interviewing for).</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/first-interview.html>First Interview</a></h3><a class=summary href=/first-interview.html><p>I had my first interview with EA today. John Vifian gave me a call at the appointed time and we talked about the job of Development Director (DD) at EA Partners (EAP). It was fun talking to him&ndash;he has some great experience in the industry.
Development Director
The DDs report to Exec Producers who report to Tom Frisina. As I understand it, DDs at EAP represent the publishers (EA&rsquo;s) interests on a project by helping guide the studio EA has a partnership with; ideally to help them take a successful game and turn it into a successful franchise.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/maxis-asst-prod-update.html>Maxis Asst Prod, Update</a></h3><a class=summary href=/maxis-asst-prod-update.html><p>Just got off the phone with Lisa Bell. The scoop is that they already have someone internal for the position&ndash;the post to EA jobs was really more of a formality. But, even though they dont have other production positions open, Lisa said she liked my resume and would like to speak to me in December. Were scheduled for a phone call 1st week of December. Pretty cool. Glad I made that phone call.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/and-on-the-eap-front.html>And On the EAP Front</a></h3><a class=summary href=/and-on-the-eap-front.html><p>Went back and forth via email yesterday with John Vifian of EA Partners. RJ said he thinks they used to be called EA Distribution, at least when he was there. RJ worked with John briefly and had a good impression. Johns a Director of Development. I believe he works for Tom Frisina&mldr;I think Rob mentioned that Tom heads up the team. John is interested in interviewing me by phone Wednesday. I&rsquo;m very excited!</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/maxis-asst-prod-update.html>Maxis Asst Prod, Update</a></h3><a class=summary href=/maxis-asst-prod-update.html><p>So I emailed Kana Ryan and she forwarded me with a nice intro to Lisa Bell. I was getting all excited that I had a good intro into the hiring manager until I emailed Toby and he told me Lisa is in HR (and therefore a gatekeeper). I did think it a bit odd that the only credit I could find for her was a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; on the Sims Online.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html>Dinner With the QS Gang</a></h3><a class=summary href=/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html><p>Just got back from dinner with some friends from my days at QuickStart, one of which is was Matthew Chamberlain of Microsoft. He reports that hes still on the hunt at MS on my behalf (which is, of course, awfully nice of him). We got together a couple weeks ago at the MS SF office to search for people to talk to. We decided it would be a good idea to start with a couple of guys at the top (it goes something like: guys at the top->studio heads->exec producers->producers->associate producers) and go from there.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/phone-tag-and-persistence.html>Phone Tag and Persistence</a></h3><a class=summary href=/phone-tag-and-persistence.html><p>My friend Auren emailed me an introduction to Tiffany Spencer who is a PR Manager (as best I can tellshe works out of SF and Ubisofts SF office is a marketing office) for Ubisoft. She emailed me once last week but I havent been able to reach her since. Perhaps shes out of town or very busy. I am reminded of how many times I have had to contact a person 10 times or more before I finally got a hold of them.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/first-movable-type-spam.html>First Movable Type Spam</a></h3><a class=summary href=/first-movable-type-spam.html><p>It was bound to happen. Got my first comment Spam on this site today. I was all excited about getting a comment until I read it. ;) Heh heh. I hope I dont have to put a filter on too soon.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/ea-10-k.html>EA 10-K</a></h3><a class=summary href=/ea-10-k.html><p>Its amazing what you can learn from reading the SEC filings for public companies. I thought Id check out EA&rsquo;s filing in June and see what I could learn about the company. Its always a great way to see where the money really is and where the company is headed, generally speaking.
So far I&rsquo;ve gleaned a few interesting tidbits:
The new EALA is going to be pretty important. EA is consolidating the old LA, Irvine, and Vegas studios into it, at substantial expense.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/the-ancient-art-of-resume-writing.html>The Ancient Art of Resume Writing</a></h3><a class=summary href=/the-ancient-art-of-resume-writing.html><p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I find writing my own resume a challenge. On the one hand, I&rsquo;m a fairly confident guy, but on the other hand, I dont really like tooting my own horn. Cant be too bold or too humble and I&rsquo;ve gotta speak the right language. There are certain things I need to communicate to get past the gatekeepers and make it all the way to the hiring manager and then land an interview.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/maxis-assistant-producer-ii.html>Maxis Assistant Producer II</a></h3><a class=summary href=/maxis-assistant-producer-ii.html><p>Just got the email that Maxis posted for an assistant producer on the SimCity series. Wow, that would be excellent&mldr;Id love to have a chance to work at Maxis (which is, btw, an EA company). I sent an email over to Kana Ryan whom I noticed was the exec producer on the SimCity series as of SimCity 4. Yah, shes probably not the hiring manager, but hopefully shell be nice enough to forward it to them&mldr;I also sent an email to Toby asking if he might know who over there is the hiring manager so I can address my interest to the right person.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/crimson-skies-notes.html>Crimson Skies Notes</a></h3><a class=summary href=/crimson-skies-notes.html><p>MS just released their sequel to Crimson Skies on the Xbox. Heh heh, they know its a good game and they want it to help drive purchases of the Xbox and subscriptions to Xbox Live. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to take some notes down about the original for some time because it was a game I enjoyed and I thought it worth reflecting on why I enjoyed it as much as I did.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/if-you-tell-them.html>If You Tell Them</a></h3><a class=summary href=/if-you-tell-them.html><p>My friend Brian Donoho (hes the guy behind the web-based system that keeps QuickLogic in business) was at a party this weekend when he bumped into a guy that works at EA in operations. He started plugging him for info on my behalf, but I think everyone was already way too into the beer part of the evening to do much good. :) Hey, you never know.

I also asked why Moby wasnt showing him on Alice in their DB and it turns out the person who put the data in originally missed him. So, I contacted Moby and got them to add his credit as the executive producer on the project. But he did a lot more than exec produce the game&ndash;he wrote the script and the dialogue while directing the voice and music.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/reinforcements.html>Reinforcements</a></h3><a class=summary href=/reinforcements.html><p>A number of weeks ago I had lunch with Erin Turner at the Sofitel hotel near the EA campus. Come to think of it, it was labor day or something. And of course, being a producer and all, Erin was in the office that day. :) Shes leading the charge on the next Bond game after all, and she was wrapping pre-beta. I was plunking away on the piano when she walked up and we went to grab lunch nearby.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/getting-closer.html>Getting Closer</a></h3><a class=summary href=/getting-closer.html><p>A couple days ago Rob emailed me letting me know that he had pitched me to EA Partners and they were interested in speaking with me. :) As I understand it, EAP is looking for producer-types at an array of levels to help manage their relationships with outside studios, I&rsquo;m guessing on one or a handful of projects at a time. Today I received an email from EA&rsquo;s job engine with more details.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/games-411.html>Games 411</a></h3><a class=summary href=/games-411.html><p>My friend Auren Hoffman just sent me a copy of Games 411 out of the blue. Nice! I was planning on getting this. Turns out the publisher is Andrew Boer. He used to be the VP of Sales for BridgePath (a company I cofounded in 1997, acquired in 2002) before he left to get his MBA over at Harvard. I wonder how he came to be involved with this project</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/alice-notes.html>Alice Notes</a></h3><a class=summary href=/alice-notes.html><p>American McGee must be friends with Tim Burton. I decided to drop $8 for a copy of Alice. Heck, I&rsquo;ve spoken to the producer and a bunch of friends have recommended the game. Took me about 20 hours to play through. The graphics were funthey set the mood of wandering through this land of dark imagination.
Excellent Interface
The music was good. The menus were excellent, starting with the startup sequence with the EA logo turning into the Cat, accompanied by light laughter turning into twisted laughter.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/first-igda-chapter-meeting-soon.html>First IGDA Chapter Meeting Soon</a></h3><a class=summary href=/first-igda-chapter-meeting-soon.html><p>Got an email a little while ago.

I though Id try and find a game of Mage in the Bay Area. Posted on Craigslist and the forums for Mage, but I havent turned up much. After looking at the limited level of Internet chatter related to the game these day, I&rsquo;m starting to think there arent that many people playing Mage. So sad. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just have to storytell a game myself, or perhaps consider other game worlds like Vampire or D&D.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/homeworld-2-notes.html>Homeworld 2 Notes</a></h3><a class=summary href=/homeworld-2-notes.html><p>Picked up a copy of HW2. You could say I opened the box with some anticipationthe first one remains one of my favorite games. It was immersive&ndash;the story was engaging, the sound built and maintained the mood, and the interface still is the easiest 3D RTS I&rsquo;ve ever seen. As for the sequel it has spawned, HW2 gives a great first impression&ndash;the production quality is certainly there. The graphics, interface, and sound have all taken evolutionary steps that are great to see.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/gdc-site-is-up.html>GDC Site Is Up</a></h3><a class=summary href=/gdc-site-is-up.html><p>The GDC site has done its soft launch (ie, pre-media blitz). Its like a web beta so everyone can fix there profiles and early-birds can get a peak and register. I&rsquo;m on the QoL panel&mldr;I&rsquo;ve even got a short profile on there. A couple days ago they asked for a picture, I had to whip out the digital camera. :p

Totally cool guy&mldr;we met for drinks last night at this chill bar with no sign (keeps the unclued out, I guess) and we chatted a bit about games. I was introduced to Matt through my friend Ben, who is friends with Matts roommate (3 degrees).

Basically, he makes it easier for everyone to do their piece on a film and seamlessly pass things to the next person for the work they need to do, all the while maintaining a great deal of transparency and insight into where things are on the project.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/first-link.html>First Link</a></h3><a class=summary href=/first-link.html><p>I thought Id Google this sitesee if it was in the search engine already. I was surprised to find a link from another blogger! Pretty cool. Wonder how he heard about the site? So far I&rsquo;ve told so few people about itmy main avenue of exposure so far is through people who I email from the domain. They sometimes notice the address.

These days most games I come across are either single-player, plot-driven (games like The Sims being the exception) or multiplayer interaction-driven. And when I say single-player games are plot-driven, I mean it to include a broad range of plot complexities. Some of these plot-driven games have rather pitiful plots, i.e. Earth is being invaded by aliens and you, the last super badass are all that stands in the way of total destruction.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/the-future-of-iwanttoworkatea.com.html>The Future of IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></h3><a class=summary href=/the-future-of-iwanttoworkatea.com.html><p>I was thinking the other day about what should happen to this domain once I land a gig at EA.

I know, I know they arent EA, but I figure I need to keep my options open. They are growing fast and they are more familiar with how to leverage my kind of biz software production experience in the game space, increasing my appeal, which is good.

I was introduced to him through my friend Jon Bass. I never would have guessed he knew people in the industry, but hes introduced me to Joel and to RJ Berg, a producer over at LucasArts. It just goes to show that when you are looking to meet people in the industry, tell everyone you can.
