The less private
your conversations, the more careful you are about what you say. And being
careful leads to less candor, less criticism, and less innovation. Thought and
private speech are the breeding ground for new, sometimes controversial ideas.
They are how we prototype, think new ideas through, refine them, and get them
ready for wider distribution and discussion.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/learning-points.html>Learning Points</a></h3><a class=summary href=/learning-points.html><p><p>When I joined Mixbook 4 years ago, we were running very large, coarse
experiments, where we&rsquo;d spend 3-6 months with 2-4 people building some new

a bit leaner, with the same sized teams typically shipping a new experiment
within 2-4 weeks. But we don&rsquo;t want to stop there. Lately we&rsquo;ve been talking
about how to get it down to 1-2 days per experiment, so we can ship 5 or

interest:</p><ol><li>hours worked</li><li>tasks completed per hour worked</li><li>unit of impact per task completed</li></ol><h2 id=hours-worked>Hours Worked</h2><p>The company culture where you work sets the tone for how many hours you work.
Startups tend to value long hours, but plenty of larger companies do too. Adding
more hours can be very effective in the short-run, but in the long-run the gains
can be elusive, as people shift more of their personal chores and relaxation
time into their work hours in order to satisfy the expectation that they are in
the office all the time, while still striking the balance that they prefer.
There are plenty of tools to counterbalance the distractions and keep focused,
from inspired goals to deadlines to pressure from a boss, but they don&rsquo;t scale
well. My guess is that its unusual to find a (knowledge worker) organization
that can sustain gains from long hours when properly accounting for hours <em>not</em>
working (but in the office!), the cost of management time to maintain a long
hours culture, and the costs of employee churn.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/contact-sales.html>Contact Sales</a></h3><a class=summary href=/contact-sales.html><p><p><img src=/images/contact-sales.jpg alt="a salesperson paywall"></p><p>These days it seems that a lot of SaaS tools are offering a free tier, one or

chose are happier (more of their work has an impact), their customers
are happier (better &lsquo;awesome&rsquo; to &lsquo;meh&rsquo; ratio for new features), and

engineer at the company. Often they are career engineers with limited

offers a huge boost in productivity by setting coding standards,
establishing the architecture, drawing the technology roadmap, and

There are two limitations of the old way: 1: you need a valid session_key (so, the user must be logged in); 2: you may only send up to 10 messages per day (without special permissions from the user). Fortunately Facebook released their Open Stream API in April 2009 and it suffers from neither restriction: you can post without a session_key and there are no explicit limits on how many posts you can make in a day. Unfortunately Facebooker does not yet offer native support for publishing to Facebook streams, at least that I could find, but it DOES support rolling your own API calls, and in this case its not that hard to do.

They chop up the potatoes, fry them in vegetable oil, and add salt. That&rsquo;s it. Like everything they make the fries are made of fresh, not frozen, ingredients. The freshness comes through in the taste and avoiding preservative is probably a lot better for you too. If you want to be on the inside, you should know about some of the stuff they do just for people that notice that kind of stuff, aka crazy detail oriented fans. First is the <a href=http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx>hidden menu</a> of items you can order, but which they do not advertise. I recommend the 4x4.

While I have been successful thus far in my area of study, I have made a decision to pursue a career in game design and development. I have some experience in managing large projects, so I might be able to apply for a project director type of position, but I&rsquo;m most interested the artistic end of game design. I am considering taking a certification course in 3D character design and animation at the university where I currently work. But I dont want to spend the money, or begin transitioning from my current position, if my chances of being able to break into the industry are slim to none. I&rsquo;m sure to be competing with students who have had much more experience in computing and art than I could ever hope to obtain at this point in my life (even though I&rsquo;m only 30). Do you think my training in psychology, and the skills that I have developed as a clinical research scientist will be desired by a game company? What type of additional training would you recommend? How much experience do most new hires (those individuals who are fresh out of college or internship) have in the area of 3D character design? I&rsquo;m wondering if a 9-month intensive course would be sufficient to compete. Are there any jobs that I might be suited for in this industry?

And since writing for the PC isnt all that different from writing for the Xbox I would suggest that you focus your efforts on the PC instead. Visual Studio + the DirectX SDK from Microsoft are the programming tools of choice but VS is expensive (DirectX works with VS and is free). You can find freeware tools that are like Visual Studio that will enable you to write games that make use of the free DirectX SDK and I suggest you locate one of those. C++ is the language most games are made with, but if you dont need extensive multimedia support (as you might not with a board game) then you will find Visual Basic a good language to learn with and make your game. There are a number of books available from Amazon that teach how to make video games. You should buy one or check one out from your library.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/interview-follow-ups.html>Interview Follow-ups</a></h3><a class=summary href=/interview-follow-ups.html><p><p><strong>Rudy Writes:</strong></p><p><em>I was reading some stuff on your website and just want to say, it&rsquo;s a really cool idea.

What requirements (skills) are needed in order to intern as an animator at EA? When submitting my portfolio what materials would I include? Does one need to have excellent drawing skills to be considered for a 3d animation position. I work full time and I go to school full time, so it is hard to concentrate on both drawing and animation. I usually stick to animation: even though, drawing does give me the vision and perspective to do my animations. How were you able to network with so many people who worked at EA?

I got into the industry more or less on pure luck. When I graduated from college, I turned down many jobs out here in the film industry at various companies in order to stay with my then Fianc in Fla. Because of this I took a job working in Broadcast design doing animation for TV commercials and News promos and various other TREMENDOUSLY boring thingsI hated it. This was around the beginning of PS1 and I was lucky enough to come across a start up company in Orlando doing games 1st party for sony. I worked on some real crap games there, but luckily enough got a break working on Duke Nukem for 3d realms and Gt interactive. After that the door opened wide for me, and I was recruited to move and work out here for Eidos interactive where I stayed for 4 yearsnot a bad place to work. But things got boring for me there so here I came to EAand I love it here, there is nothing like knowing whatever game you work on will sell at least a million units. AS for a strategy for getting in here, well that is a tough one. EA really doesnt tend to hire a lot of new talent they really like people who have a lot or at least some experience in the industry, and more importantly people who look as though they can grow professionally. Internships are great if you are starting out, but they are not easy to get. Put together your best work and submit it, then cross your fingers. If you do get in, work your ass off, learn all you can, and chances are you stand a good chance of getting a job here. Sending countless demos is not the way to go. In general the same people view the demos all the time so you arent tricking anyone. Anyways I hope this answers your questions and feel free to post as many as you want, I will reply as often as I can.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/animator-roles.html>Animator Roles</a></h3><a class=summary href=/animator-roles.html><p><p><strong>Thomas Writes:</strong></p><p><em>Chris: Can you describe different roles or capacities that an animator might perform in the game industry?

I really only see the Tiger Woods Golf one, which is about as good as it gets, but do they offer anymore? Is this a one intern deal? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>The internship position I have now did not even exist before I landed itI had the good fortune of meeting the right people who offered to get me in. Keep in mind that there are lots of positions that never get advertised (my guess is less than 20% of positions in the industry are ever made public before they are filled) and some positions that are specifically created for people that have made the right friends and the right impression. You greatly limit your opportunities if you are only going for the positions that are visible through advertisements and web pages a.k.a. non-networking channels. | I&rsquo;ve heard somewhere that 80% of job holders in the US got their job through a connection rather than an advertisement. The game industry places even more of an emphasis on personal connection with people they hireso that number is probably even higher. | That said, so far the only other ones I&rsquo;ve seen advertised at EA have been for unannounced products with EA Partners (they handle projects that are developed by non-EA studios and they are growing fast). As far as I know, production internships are far fewer in number than those for engineering, art, and marketing. One might expect as much, considering there are often 20+ artists/engineers/marketers per production person on a team.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/qa-interview-post-mortem.html>QA Interview Post-mortem</a></h3><a class=summary href=/qa-interview-post-mortem.html><p><p><strong>A Reader Writes:</strong></p><p>Here&rsquo;s another rejection QA story to read.

I currently work as a Senior Process Manager for a top 10 financial institution. In my current role, I am responsible for ensuring that our institution (over 80 million accounts) complies with multiple forms of USA Patriot Act legislation, including Office of Foreign Assets requirements and Bank Secrecy Act requirements. I manage a direct team of four Process Managers and an indirect team of over 20 Operations/Process Managers across our company, including across 6 different geographic locations and multiple business types. This is all well and good, but I am extremely bored of my job. My true passion is playing video games, which I have done since I was old enough to hold a joystick or to stick a cassette tape in a Commodore 64 and type &ldquo;Load, 8, 1&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve always felt that the ideal role in life would be one in which you do what you love and you love what you do. I am not in that role today. While my gaming experience goes only as deep as to have played them for countless years, I do have a number of skills that I believe are applicable to just about any business environment. I am trained and certified as a Green Belt in Six Sigma, which is a process management methodology, possess an associate&rsquo;s degree in Project Management, and bring a wide array of functional skills to the table, including multi-tasking, people management, requirements definition, process analysis, leadership and a strong knowledge of regulations and legal affairs. I am not sure what the right positon would be for someone like me at a gaming company, but I do know that I would be happy with just about any position that let me help an industry I enjoyed rather than one that simply paid the bills.

I hate to come off as arrogant, however, I have learned that this may be the only chance I have&ndash;every person trying to get a job &ldquo;fluffs up&rdquo; their resume, advertising skills they dont really have. Thus, on a resume, I am the same as anyone else, because even though I may be honest about my skills, I look no different on a resume than someone whos fluffed theirs up. I know that EA must get thousands of job applications and resumes on a weekly basis. My question is: how does one get noticed? I think that there are 2 kinds of programmers&ndash;those that do it for the money, and those that were born with the skill. I am the latter. Even when entering college, I already had more programming and software engineering skills than most PROFESSORS (I wont even compare with the students). Again I&rsquo;m sorry to be so arrogant, but I feel it is the only way to set myself apart. So, even though I may be a more talented and skilled software engineer than most 10-20 year veterans, I am immediately labeled as the &ldquo;college newbie&rdquo; who has &ldquo;no software engineering skills&rdquo; and couldnt write robust code if my life depended on it. In fact, I dont blame them for thinking this&ndash;when I see the other students in my class, even those who love to program, I would also put most of them in that category. My question is&ndash;HOW DOES ONE STAND OUT? How can I show EA that I have what it takes, that I can work with their best. If I had to, I would work for them for FREE for a MONTH just to be able to show them this: whatever it takes. I know that having the right networks count, and that I would have no problem getting a job there if my sisters boyfriends dads cousins boyfriend was a senior software engineer. But I truly believe that if only I could show them my skills, show them that I can solve anything they dish out at me with style and robustness, that they would give me a chance&ndash;if only. Any help anyone could give me would be truly appreciated.</em></p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/transfering-to-executive-producer.html>Transfering To Executive Producer</a></h3><a class=summary href=/transfering-to-executive-producer.html><p><p><strong>Chris Writes:</strong></p><p><em>I have about three years experience in creating stochastic simulations and visualization systems for the US Army at WSMR.

So, I decided I would share my experiences and try to blaze a path for the next person. Much of the blog was written while I was in the middle of figuring out how to find a job with EA. I have since been hired by EA as a producer on an unannounced action-adventure game so the tactics I have used have at least worked once!</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/emailing-me.html>Emailing Me</a></h3><a class=summary href=/emailing-me.html><p><p>Thanks for saying hello!

He offered to help me land an internship since its the easiest way to get me in the door and give me a chance to prove what I can do. I asked whether I had been out of college too long, but he seemed confident he could hook me up with a position. Sweet. It will give me the chance to learn from the <em>inside</em> AND it gives me exposure to the people I want to work with. I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing back from him! I&rsquo;m going to follow up in a couple weeks if I dont hear from him sooner. I wasnt clear on whether the internship he had in mind started in January or if it recruited in January to start during the summer. Youll know when I know. ;)</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/growing-pains-for-the-industry.html>Growing Pains For The Industry</a></h3><a class=summary href=/growing-pains-for-the-industry.html><p><p>I&rsquo;ve been told by a few people that getting into the game industry these days is a bit trickier than it used to be&ndash;now that its grown into something with some amount of status (where it used to be considered more of a hobby than an industry), a lot of people have taken an interest in working in the industry. So, you might expect it would be a buyers market for talent.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/update-from-lisa-bell.html>Update From Lisa Bell</a></h3><a class=summary href=/update-from-lisa-bell.html><p><p>Lisa Bell called me this afternoon with a quick <a href=/maxis-asst-prod-update-number-2.html>update</a>: shes been in touch with her counterpart at EARS: Rachel McIntyre. Rachel was out of town when I <a href=/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round-number-1.html>met with EAP</a>, otherwise I would probably have met her then, though I keep hearing her name. Anyway, Lisa has also been in touch with a couple of her Canadian counterparts too; but everyone (outside of Maxis at the moment) is hella busy hiring, so she thinks they will take a couple days to get back to her. So Lisa and I have a followup scheduled next week.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/spike-tvs-video-game-awards.html>Spike Tvs Video Game Awards</a></h3><a class=summary href=/spike-tvs-video-game-awards.html><p><p>Shawn Kresal sent me this article about Spike TVs video game awards show. Itll be interesting to see how well games and TV mix&mldr;I suspect it will take some trial-and-error to find a good mix.

While I wasnt a fit for somewhat <a href=/first-ea-app-complete.html>structural reasons</a> I figured there were probably other areas that could use some improvement. We connected this evening and Craig <em>buried</em> me with help and advice!</p><p>I started the conversation with a quick recap of what I was looking for: how I could have presented myself better and what I should do to be better prepared when I interview with other groups at EA. Craig told me that everyone liked me and a few people had spoken up saying that EA really needs to hire me&ndash;somehow find me a position. :) In the end, he said, EAP isnt equipped to bring someone new to the industry up to speed in the roles they are hiring for right now. But said hed like to do whatever he can to help me get a position at EA and he was instructing HR to see what they could find in Studio.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/phone-call-with-lisa-bell.html>Phone Call With Lisa Bell</a></h3><a class=summary href=/phone-call-with-lisa-bell.html><p><p>Lisa and I <a href=/maxis-asst-prod-update-number-2.html>spoke briefly</a> a couple months ago, before scheduling todays informational interview.

She started by mentioning that this site has been an item over at Maxis and the blog entry that mentioned our first encounter had gotten her some attention. :) I hope it was good! I took the opportunity to let her know that I dont post anything that I suspect or am told is confidential, and I give my conversation partners the final say on material I put on here.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/a-quick-hello-with-david-de-martini.html>A Quick Hello With David De Martini</a></h3><a class=summary href=/a-quick-hello-with-david-de-martini.html><p><p>As <a href=/intro-to-jose-martin.html>my meeting</a> with Jose was coming to a close, in walked David De Martini. I had emailed DeMar to try and setup a meeting but we hadn&rsquo;t set anything up yet. Turns out Bing put me on his calendar to his surprise. :p Made me feel pretty cool that <a href=/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html>Bing</a> got him here on my behalf, but I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to inconvenience DeMar! He offered to reschedule since now wasn&rsquo;t a good time for him to step away and I was happy to accept.

I asked what makes the difference between a good producer and a great producer and he said there were three areas where a great producer excels:</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html>Lunch With Bing Gordon</a></h3><a class=summary href=/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html><p><p>So the other day I&rsquo;m in 250&mldr; :) After chatting with Tara I headed over to the front desk to let Jenny Turick (<a href=/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html>Bing</a>s exec assistant) know I was here. That is, the front desk of <em>death</em>.</p><p><strong>The Front Desk Puzzle &rsquo; 10 points</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed, after about 4 visits, that when the front desk calls someone and tells me that they have confirmed that they know I&rsquo;m in 250 it can actually mean one of a few different things: a) they left a message for someone other than the person I&rsquo;m supposed to meet with, b) they left a message for the person I&rsquo;m supposed to meet with, c) they talked to someone who doesnt know who I am, doesnt care, and is not coming down to see me, d) they talked to the right person and they are actually coming right down. It&rsquo;s like a test to see if you can figure out how to actually be on time to a meeting in that building. ;) On this occasion I started 10 minutes early&ndash;at 5 late I asked the front desk to make certain they had called Jenny and she had actually <em>said</em> she was coming down. At 10 minutes late I overhear them pick up the phone and apparently tell Jenny that, yes, there was someone down here named Scott Bonds. Heh heh. The moral of the story is that if you have a meeting in 250, call the person you are meeting yourself. Were all gamers here, think of it as the first puzzle for gaining entry into the main dungeon. ;)</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/flyby-chat-with-philip-gee.html>Flyby Chat With Philip Gee</a></h3><a class=summary href=/flyby-chat-with-philip-gee.html><p><p>While Tara and I <a href=/sit-down-with-tara-s.html>chatted</a> away Philip Gee walked by and Tara quickly introduced us. Phil handles college recruiting for EA and Tara wanted to see if he might have some ideas. I&rsquo;ve been out of college too long for his department, nevertheless he offered to fill me in on which teams he knows of that are hiring producers right now and what the calendar looks like. He pointed out that in December, after the big Christmas push in October, a lot of the teams are working on their pilots with a small team of artists and developers. They are getting ready to pitch their new project before they ramp up the entire team in Q1 on the new year. Nevertheless, there are other teams that are entirely new or are otherwise on a different calendar cycle. Good stuff!

I was wandering the area that the geese had marked as their own (at least, I think the dropping saturate sidewalk must be a popular hangout for them) when <a href=/a-couple-shout-outs.html>Tara</a> called and we converged on 250 to talk. Tara made sure to introduce me to everyone she could along the path from the front of the building to the cushy chairs, because shes just cool that way. :)</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/the-swedish-connection.html>The Swedish Connection</a></h3><a class=summary href=/the-swedish-connection.html><p><p>A few weeks ago I heard from Fredrik Thylander (a game designer with <a href=http://dice.se/>Digital I&rsquo;llusions</a>) who had stumbled across this site and sent me an email just to say he likes the site and good luck. He also put a good word in for <a href=/first-interview.html>John Vifian</a> and EAP&ndash;good bunch of guys to work with. Today I heard from <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=11359/">Sean Decker</a> who, it turns out, is over in Sweden working with a team on the Battlefield series. I know that Fredrik is working on the series too. Heh heh, small world. Man, I would <em>love</em> to work in Sweden, I&rsquo;m very jealous of these guys. :)</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/on-immersion-and-tron-2.0.html>On I'mmersion And Tron 2.0</a></h3><a class=summary href=/on-immersion-and-tron-2.0.html><p><p>I just finished <a href=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tron-20>Tron 2.0</a> and prior to that by a few days I had watched the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009TB5G/qid=1070186348/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7998853-1870303?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846">Two Towers, extended version</a> and its appendices. I find the making of the LOTR movies and Peter Jackson as a supreme inspiration&ndash;and it reminds me of what I&rsquo;m looking for in game production. I want to help bottle the awe and joy of those moments I&rsquo;ve found in books and on screen and bring them to games.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/no-one-lives-forever-notes.html>No One Lives Forever Notes</a></h3><a class=summary href=/no-one-lives-forever-notes.html><p><p>Well, its a <a href=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever>top rated</a> game so I thought Id check out what its all about. I opted not to read the reviews first and just let it impress me on its own. Of course, the graphics are a little dated, but I liked <a href=/alice-notes.html>Alice</a> a lot and its getting a little long in the tooth. My favorite games have survived a graphics cycle or two and are still fun in any case.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/first-ea-app-complete.html>First EA App Complete</a></h3><a class=summary href=/first-ea-app-complete.html><p><p>Heard from <a href=/the-campaign-begins.html>Rob Moreno</a> today letting me know that EAP isn&rsquo;t ready to bring me on just yet. Darn! I was hoping that they would see past my lack of game industry experience but it looks like they noticed. ;) So that wraps my <a href=/6-hours-of-interviews.html>first</a> formal application to a position with EA! Not too shabby&ndash;I made 5 new production contacts, several of whom were kind enough to offer me help after the interview was over.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/on-bing-gordons-calendar.html>On Bing Gordons Calendar</a></h3><a class=summary href=/on-bing-gordons-calendar.html><p><p>I feel very lucky to have been introduced to <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,11/>Bing Gordon</a> by <a href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html>Neil Young</a>. Bing has offered to meet with me in a week and a half where well no doubt have the chance to speak about a number of interesting topics. Id love to hear the tales he has from the <a href=/the-ea-way.html>early days</a> of EAhes one of the 7 original founders from back in 1982. That makes him one of the rock stars of the industry&mldr;I can hardly believe I get to sit down with him! Its going to be awesome. I feel like I&rsquo;m going up to the mountain and meeting the guru to learn who-knows-what pearls of wisdom.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/some-thank-you-cards.html>Some Thank You Cards</a></h3><a class=summary href=/some-thank-you-cards.html><p><p>I thought it would be nice to thank everyone I met with during the course of my <a href=/6-hours-of-interviews.html>interviews</a>. I learned a lot and a number of people even offered their business cards and told me to call or email if I had more questions. Thank yous are definitely in order! I was thinking about sending emails, but I decided on personalize hand-written thank you cards. I think cards convey greater appreciation and courtesy because they take more effort. I like to send them promptly too&ndash;I think it better conveys my respect and sincerity when its prompt. So, I just spent an hour writing and addressing cards to each of the 10 people I met. Now I am off to drive them to the post office so that they will begin their journey towards Redwood City first thing Saturday morning. And then some sleep. :)</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round.html>In-person Interviews With EAP, Round</a></h3><a class=summary href=/in-person-interviews-with-eap-round.html><p><p>Its been quite a day! 5 hours of interviews stacked back-to-back with a bunch of the EAP team&mldr;and this is just the first round of in-person interviews. These were proceeded by two <a href=/first-interview.html>phone interviews</a> a couple weeks ago. It was pretty cool meeting everyone and having the chance to ask a lot of questions about EA and the production roles here.</p><p>Craig Alexander told me the reason for the high number of interviews was that EA is very consensus oriented&ndash;I will be working with a lot of people very closely under a lot of pressure and it&rsquo;s important that everyone get along really well. It sounds like a good idea to me. And I get 10 more people to ask about EA and learn more of the culture and way or working at my game company of choice. :)</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/chat-with-ofer-estline.html>Chat With Ofer Estline</a></h3><a class=summary href=/chat-with-ofer-estline.html><p><p>Ofer and I met at EALA after work (well, not really, Ofer planned to stay until midnight) to talk about EA and Development Directors (DDs). First a quick tour of EALA which is presently packed with three studios. Its nice and cozy until January when the new offices come online.</p><p>I asked Ofer to tell me more about DD vs Producers at EA. I&rsquo;ve heard the story from a couple Producers, but Ofer is the first DD I&rsquo;ve had a chance to sit down with. He explained that the DD role is reserved for those proficient in the art of management&ndash;of people and projects. The DDs does stuff like write up the reviews, assign the tasks, manage the schedules, assign office space, and resolve disputes. They take the vision for the game from the Producer and make it happen. The DD role was split off from the producer and developer roles in order to allow these roles to be focused on design and programming respectively. That way, if you are a whiz programmer you can advance on a career track where you become a guru (technical director) without needing to become a manager and deal with all the new skill areas that such a move requires. Brilliant idea if you ask me.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/the-ea-way.html>The EA Way</a></h3><a class=summary href=/the-ea-way.html><p><p>While I was visiting <a href=/bond-and-jordan-maynard.html>Jordan Maynard</a> last week, I noticed an old EA advertisement framed on his desk. It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the <a href=http://chrishecker.com/Can_a_Computer_Make_You_Cry%3F>company</a> and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun&ndash;we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world. Jordan was kind enough to make me a copy and I think its worth sharing. Here is the ad published in the September 1983 issue of <a href=http://www.scientificamerican.com/>Scientific American</a>:</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/online-networking.html>Online Networking</a></h3><a class=summary href=/online-networking.html><p><p>I was recently asked how online networking tools like <a href=http://www.spoke.com/>Spoke</a> have contributed to my efforts to meet people within the game industry. I signed up for Spoke, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/>Linked-In</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster>Friendster</a>, and couple others a few months ago. But none of them were much help for meeting people in the game industry.</p><p><strong>Whats Missing?</strong></p><p>First, I havent met many people in the game industry that choose to spend a lot of time on networking&ndash;it sorta happens during the course of working in the industry but the industry is otherwise a bit insulated. It seems that game makers have less of a need for active networking than the practitioners of other entertainment industries. If you are actor, for example, attention is your currency. If you are game programmer or an animator, networking is still important, but an active networking hobby isnt as central to a successful career. There are people who are exceptions to the rule, and I <em>am</em> operating off very little data so far, but thats the initial look of things to me. Most of the people I talk to tell me they got into the industry through a friend; yet when I asked my friend Auren (who knows half the people in San Francisco) he had trouble naming <em>any</em> game contacts off the top of his head. The online networking tools didnt do much better&ndash;just not that many game people in there.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/6-hours-of-interviews.html>6 Hours Of Interviews</a></h3><a class=summary href=/6-hours-of-interviews.html><p><p>Got the email packet for my EAP interviews this week and I note that its going to be a marathon of 30 to 45 minute interviews. I&rsquo;ll get the chance to meet a lot of the people I would be working with and I&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to meet all the different titles I want to learn more about&ndash;Associate Development Director (DD), Associate Producer (AP), Producer, Senior Producer, VP. Thats some serious interviewing though! I feel like I should run up a hill and eat broccoli the day before or something. :) The gig I&rsquo;m hoping for is an Assistant Producer role with EAP. I saw Scott Evans on the interview list. I <a href=/system-shock-3.html>emailed</a> him a while back about System Shock 2 which he produced. Its going to be pretty cool to meet him in person and to know that I might get to work with someone that made one of the best games ever, IMHO.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/aps-and-morrowind.html>APs and Morrowind</a></h3><a class=summary href=/aps-and-morrowind.html><p><p>Met up with my friend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1828266/?ref_=fn_al_nm_3">Aaron Butler</a> for lunch. Hes an Associate Producer with MTV and hes earned credits for editing and directing as well. Hes had some offers from VH1 too&ndash;basically hes totally kicking butt down here. We used to be roommates and before that we were involved in <a href=http://asuc.org/>student government</a> together at Cal. Aarons been making films for the absolute love of it since he was in junior high&ndash;seeing him doing so well is really cool.

He and Amy are big gamers and hes tried to fit in some <a href=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/shadowbane/>Shadowbane</a>, but its hard to do much but clean the house and watch Jerry Springer.

For one, I timed a bunch of eBay auctions poorly and I&rsquo;m packing them now. It probably doesnt help that I stayed up late opening up Pass 2 in SSX3. I also sent some emails out to contacts at EALA. I dont know if the new studio has opened yet, I&rsquo;m guessing it hasnt. Id like to see the old one while I&rsquo;m down there and say hi to some guys I&rsquo;ve talked to a bunch of times. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll hear back from Erin about her friend down there and I just got a really nice email I was CCed on from Neil to the guys he suggested I meet. <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,398866/>Chris Plummer</a> is in LA and hes the guy that got into <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Systems>Origin</a> using the say hi to everyone you can approach kinda like me.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/in-person-for-eap-scheduled.html>In-person For EAP Scheduled</a></h3><a class=summary href=/in-person-for-eap-scheduled.html><p><p>I heard from Stephanie of EAP last night&ndash;I&rsquo;m scheduled to spend some face-to-face time with the EAP folks next week.

I&rsquo;m really looking forward to sitting down with them and some of the EAP team and getting a better feel for how EAP works! <em>And</em> asking more questions from my unending font of questions about game production and the industry.

Except when you plug it into someone elses machine, program the fire button to emulate the keypress of &rsquo;e&rsquo; and then wait for your, uh, &lsquo;friend&rsquo; to fly a plane while playing Battlefield: 1942.

Erin took off for her appearance at Stanford and Jordan sat me down and showed me what he was working on. He helps with the animation on Bond&ndash;he develops some of the custom tools they use and the capabilities are seriously ahead of the pack.</p><p>As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves&ndash;and the character moves properly, transitions and all. The animators still have to build all the moves, but the intermediary states arent a problem anymore. On top of that, hes found a way to get the number of key states for the skeletons down dramatically by using this method&ndash;for a substantial memory savings. Really brilliant stuff.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/lunch-with-erin-turner.html>Lunch With Erin Turner</a></h3><a class=summary href=/lunch-with-erin-turner.html><p><p>After I said <a href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html>goodbye</a> to Neil I headed to the lobby of 250.

Once she appeared I pried myself off the console and we headed to lunch at the EA cafeteria. My first time there&mldr;man if the cafeterias had been like this at Berkeley. The food was entirely, you know, identifiable.</p><p>I told her about my meeting with Neil as I wondered what it all meant. She assured me that its all good and that Neil is an ideal guy for me to know at EA. With that we got to talking about the challenges with growing the industry, especially marketing games to females. I brought up a recent lecture by <a href=http://www.tompeters.com/>Tom Peters</a> where he talks about marketing to women and points out what seems to me a good solution: we need more game companies with boards, EPs, programmers and organizations that look more like the market we want to go after (i.e. more women wherever there arent that many right now). Heh heh, she had heard the broadcast too.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html>Sit Down With Neil Young</a></h3><a class=summary href=/sit-down-with-neil-young.html><p><p>When Neil <a href=/an-email-from-neil-young.html>offered</a> to meet with me last week it was sort of like I had written a blog about how I like epic movies and then I got an email from <a href=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/>Peter Jackson</a> offering to meet with me. Basically, it was really cool :) So I was looking forward to meeting Neil and seeing what it was we would talk about.</p><p><strong>Who Are You, Who Are Any Of Us?</strong></p><p>There was no open position we were meeting to talk about&ndash;I was just looking for advice and I was excited to be talking to someone who really knows his stuff.

Not only could they program&ndash;they were communicators who worked well with our customers.

Liz Wakefield made the whole thing happen and seems like shed be cool to just hang with. I didnt get a chance to speak much with Jennifer Olsen, but Id love to learn more about what its like to be Editor-in-Chief for <em>the</em> game magazine. And Bill Swartz was a straight to the point, no bullshit, really good insights into production kinda guy. Totally been there, done that and now hes at his own studio.

The meeting centered on a discussion of the newly released whitepaper by the <a href=http://wiki.igda.org/Online_Games_SIG/Steering_Committee>Online Games Committee</a>. John Welch of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockwave.com>Shockwave.com</a>, Dave Rohrl of <a href=http://www.pogo.com>EA Online</a>, Margaret Wallace of <a href=http://www.skunkstudios.com/>Skunk Studios</a>, and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developer_Magazine>Game Developer Magazine</a>) moderating.</p><p>I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker. I finally met Liz Wakefield in person (after a few emails back and forth)&ndash;she chairs the chapter and serves as the operations manager for the IGDA. I spoke to her at <a href=http://www.yelp.com/biz/buzz-9-cafe-san-francisco>Buzz9</a> afterwards and learned that she majored in English and sorta fell into the role through her job at CMP.

She was out of town on business and vacation, so that explains it. Pretty cool stuff though; she just had a meeting with MTV.</p><p>Tiffany noted that the Ubisoft office in SF is in fact a marketing office; though it is also home to a number of Ubisoft producers who manage relationships with their local studio partners (sorta like the role at EAP I&rsquo;m interviewing for). MS, Nintendo, Sony, Activision, and Ubisoft are all important players she says, though she thinks they are a little bureaucratic (as they have to be since they are so large).

John Vifian gave me a call at the <a href=/and-on-the-eap-front.html>appointed time</a> and we talked about the job of Development Director (DD) at EA Partners (EAP). It was fun talking to him&ndash;he has some great experience in the industry.</p><p><strong>Development Director</strong></p><p>The DDs report to Exec Producers who report to Tom Frisina. As I understand it, DDs at EAP represent the publishers (EA&rsquo;s) interests on a project by helping guide the studio EA has a partnership with; ideally to help them take a successful game and turn it into a successful franchise. That involves the omnipresent budget, schedule, and product/quality <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1556159005/ref=sib_vae_pg_4/104-7998853-1870303?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=triangle&amp;p=S045&amp;twc=8&amp;checkSum=liEp6n4LqpAGxqgPYRnlD61L72TBrBNPnW1T5JKzZmo%3D#reader-link">balancing act</a> for which the DD is ultimately responsible. It sounds a lot like a publisher-side Producer role as I&rsquo;ve seen them at other publishers. The DD at Maxis is a bit heavier on the technical side of things and is internal to the studio, so EAPs DD seems a little different. I think I recall John mentioning that the role is somewhat new for EAP, but I&rsquo;m not certain if I remember that correctly.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/maxis-asst-prod-update.html>Maxis Asst Prod, Update</a></h3><a class=summary href=/maxis-asst-prod-update.html><p><p>Just got off the phone with Lisa Bell.

Hopefully shell realize what a catch I am ;)I&rsquo;ll see if I can convince her by giving her a phone call or two. I&rsquo;m wondering if I should just take a stab at who the hiring manager might be and email some of the producers on the credits for the other SimCity games&mldr;</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html>Dinner With the QS Gang</a></h3><a class=summary href=/dinner-with-the-qs-gang.html><p><p>Just got back from dinner with some friends from my days at QuickStart, one of which is was Matthew Chamberlain of Microsoft. He reports that hes still on the hunt at MS on my behalf (which is, of course, awfully nice of him). We got together a couple weeks ago at the MS SF office to search for people to talk to. We decided it would be a good idea to start with a couple of guys at the top (it goes something like: guys at the top->studio heads->exec producers->producers->associate producers) and go from there. He tells me hes helping because he cares about his MS stock price. Indeed. Heh heh. He also reminded me that he can hook me up with any <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/company/microsoft-studios>MS published</a> games at a big discount. :)</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/phone-tag-and-persistence.html>Phone Tag and Persistence</a></h3><a class=summary href=/phone-tag-and-persistence.html><p><p>My friend Auren emailed me an introduction to Tiffany Spencer who is a PR Manager (as best I can tellshe works out of SF and Ubisofts SF office is a <a href=https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/about_ubisoft/world_presence/biz_northamerica.aspx>marketing office</a>) for <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft>Ubisoft</a>.

On the one hand, I&rsquo;m a fairly confident guy, but on the other hand, I dont really like tooting my own horn. Cant be too bold or too humble and I&rsquo;ve gotta speak the right language.

My friend Mel is threatening to find a way to get <a href=http://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video22637>Georgy</a> to my next <a href=http://www.forbes.com/infoimaging/free_forbes/2003/0512/127.html>movie night</a> because I said that she is cute. But I&rsquo;ve got my own campaign to think about. My campaign to land a gig with <a href=https://www.ea.com/locations/redwood-shores>EA in Redwood City</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve decided I want to work for EA. I thought I just wanted to work in the game industry, but I visited EA in Redwood last week and I was blown away. Rob Moreno, a recruiter there is a friend of a friend and he offered to show me around even though he recruits corporate and I&rsquo;m interested in game production. I just had a great time. EA&rsquo;s got a great campus and Rob really sold me on what a great place EA would be to work. It was already at the top of my list, but after meeting with him I decided to take it up a notch and begin my campaign to work at EA.</p></p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/copyright-this.html>Copyright This</a></h3><a class=summary href=/copyright-this.html><p><p>I decided to copyright my DNA (TM). I mentioned this to my parents, and they
produced a copy of the End User License Agreement (EULA) that I signed for my
DNA when I was just a few seconds old, and complained of numerous violations
(they still claim to be the original authors, with all visible evidence to the
contrary). But, reading legal newsgroups has kept me abreast of the latest, and
I knew that a contract with a minor is non-binding. Besides, it doesn&rsquo;t even
look like my digital signature. Nevertheless, they sued me for the copyrights
my DNA and for the emotional trauma caused by my alleged abuse of their DNA
during my alleged childhood, in what appeared to be a clear alleged violation
of our alleged agreement.</p></p></a></p></div></body></html>
