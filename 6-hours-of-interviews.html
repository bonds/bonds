<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Got the email packet for my EAP interviews this week and I note that its going to be a marathon of 30 to 45 minute interviews. I&rsquo;ll get the chance to meet a lot of the people I would be working with and I&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to meet all the different titles I want to learn more about&ndash;Associate Development Director (DD), Associate Producer (AP), Producer, Senior Producer, VP. Thats some serious interviewing though! I feel like I should run up a hill and eat broccoli the day before or something. :) The gig I&rsquo;m hoping for is an Assistant Producer role with EAP. I saw Scott Evans on the interview list. I <a href=/system-shock-3.html>emailed</a> him a while back about System Shock 2 which he produced. Its going to be pretty cool to meet him in person and to know that I might get to work with someone that made one of the best games ever, IMHO.</p></div></body></html>
