<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/leadership.html>#leadership</a></div><p>My ideal product manager is more interested in disproving their idea than
proving it.</p><p>They are a scientist with the humility to <em>expect</em> they&rsquo;ll be wrong, the
patience to try again, and the hunger to find the truth however unaesthetic it
may be. They are a business person, more interested in getting results than
questing after their ideal UI or zero bugs. They are a crafts person, not an
artist&ndash;they value utility over beauty. They are a judge, not a legislator. They
are an anthropologist, not a therapist. They are editor, not an author.</p><p>Does this also describe my ideal CEO? No.</p></div></body></html>
