<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Before I took off I stopped by to say hi to <a href=/first-interview.html>John Vifian</a> and <a href=/on-the-phone-with-craig-alexander.html>Craig Alexander</a> to put a face with the name. I noticed that John had a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/286?crid=411">wireless Logitech joystick</a>&ndash;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting one. But he says it sucks. Except when you plug it into someone elses machine, program the fire button to emulate the keypress of &rsquo;e&rsquo; and then wait for your, uh, &lsquo;friend&rsquo; to fly a plane while playing Battlefield: 1942. So, if you know John, and youve been ejecting out of your plane a lot lately, look for strange dongles hanging off you computer. ;)</p><p><em>Updated on October 6th, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
