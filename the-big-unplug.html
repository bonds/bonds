<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/security.html>#security</a></div><p><img src=https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/alien-self-destruct.jpg alt=7></p><p>I posted this on my personal Facebook account yesterday morning:</p><p><em>I want to see what life is like without a (personal) Facebook account for a while. Seems the teenagers are doing fine (<a href=http://mashable.com/2013/08/11/teens-facebook/)>http://mashable.com/2013/08/11/teens-facebook/)</a>. I&rsquo;m going to nuke my account (from orbit) this evening (it&rsquo;s the only way to be sure). You can find me at <a href=https://ggr.com/>https://ggr.com/</a> and <a href=mailto:scott@ggr.com>scott@ggr.com</a>. See you on the other side!</em></p><p>It was funny to see everyone&rsquo;s responses. A couple people pointed out that most of my posts were <a href=http://runkeeper.com/>Runkeeper</a> jog updates, implying that <em>they</em> won&rsquo;t be missing out on much as I journey into the Facebook abyss. Fair enough. :)</p><p>The hardest part of deleting my account was moving the apps over to my work Facebook account. I still develop apps that integrate with Facebook, so I need to have accounts to test with even if I&rsquo;m no longer spamming my friends and family with pictures from my morning jog. It turns out before you can activate developer powers on a Facebook account it must be verified via phone via text message. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to give T-Mobile <a href=http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/10/t-mobile-rocks.html>another try</a>, so last night I stopped by my local T-Mobile, picked up a nano-SIM with <a href=http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/pay-by-the-day-cell-phone-plans>some credits</a> for $23, borrowed Catherine&rsquo;s sim unlocked phone, entered the number into Facebook&rsquo;s mobile verifier, got the text, verified my account, then gave my work account admin powers on the various apps. Whew!</p><p>For those interested, here are the steps I took:</p><ol><li>downloaded a <a href=http://readwrite.com/2013/02/01/how-to-backup-your-facebook-data-in-5-easy-steps>backup</a> of all my Facebook data</li><li>created a new Facebook account for work</li><li>bought a prepaid phone number and used it to verify my new account</li><li>from my old account, invited my new account to be an admin on all my Facebook apps and pages</li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674>deleted</a> my account</li></ol><p>Facebook let me know I have 14 days to cancel the <a href=http://www.markta.co.uk/alien/chapter12.htm>emergency destruct system</a>. I wonder if and when they&rsquo;ll actually have deleted my data and all its backups. Props to Facebook for making the process relatively easy.</p></div></body></html>
