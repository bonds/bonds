I currently attend Ohio State where I am studying Computer Science and Engineering. During the course of my major (which I begin in less than a month), I will have the opportunity to take a number of graphics courses, though all of these courses are centered in building graphics through the C language, at least from what I&rsquo;ve been told. I have recently become aware of a smaller school in Ohio that offers a Game and Simulation Development degree that concentrates on the &ldquo;arts/theatre/graphical elements&rdquo; of game design. I want to work my way up the ladder and be a game designer in the future. Given EA&rsquo;s way of creating a games graphics (whatever that way is), would a programming intensive background, or the above Game Development background serve me better?</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>Few game designers that I&rsquo;ve met at EA have extensive CS training, but thats not necessarily a good thing&ndash;there are some definite advantages to designers who understand how to build what they are designing. Having a solid knowledge of C and C++ will open more doors at EA than would a knowledge of art production IMHO and the first thing you need to do at EA is get in any way you can&ndash;you can find your way to becoming a designer much more easily from the inside than the outside.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Jeff&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
