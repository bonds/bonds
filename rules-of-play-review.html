It sounds excellent&ndash;I&rsquo;m adding it to my reading list. I&rsquo;ve also added a new blog category called &ldquo;Background Reading&rdquo; for the purpose of sharing with my fellow newbies my sources for a lot of the industry background info that you see showing up in these blog entries. I&rsquo;ll start adding them as I read them and then see about adding the stuff I&rsquo;ve already read, at least the ones I can remember&mldr;there have been a lot. ;)</p><p><em>Updated on October 9th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to the no-longer-in-existence background reading category. Replaced the <em>Rules of Play</em> link with one that works. Replaced the link for Shawn Kresal with one that works.</p></div></body></html>
