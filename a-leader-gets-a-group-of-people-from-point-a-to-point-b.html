<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/leadership.html>#Leadership</a></div><p>Bad leaders choose the wrong goal or fail to choose one at all. Their group ends up worse off. Divisive leaders optimize for a subgroup and the &lsquo;in&rsquo; group is more happy, the &lsquo;out&rsquo; group is less happy. They are playing a zero-sum game. Selfish leaders are an extreme of the divisive leader&ndash;the selfish leader IS the &lsquo;in&rsquo; group.</p><p>Good leaders choose a goal where everyone wins, and they achieve it.</p><p>The better the leader, the bigger and better the outcomes and the bigger and broader &rsquo;everyone&rsquo; turns out to be. Alan Mulally famously [turned Ford around][https://www.amazon.com/American-Icon-Mulally-Fight-Company/dp/0307886069], taking them from losing $17B/year to profitable and growing. He got Ford&rsquo;s zero-sum-game-playing shareholders, executives, employees, car dealers, bankers, factory worker, union leaders, and parts suppliers to align, sacrifice, work, and win or lose together.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>Thank you to [Chris Jenson][https://files.tablegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/09201856/TTGBio-Jenson-050620.pdf] from the [Table Group][https://www.tablegroup.com/] who was my coach and first told me &ldquo;a leader gets a group of people from point A to point B&rdquo; and I liked that statement so much I kept repeating it and thinking about it and blogging about it.</p></div></body></html>
