<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/security.html>#security</a></div><p><img src=https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/optout.jpg alt=26></p><p>A government with easy access to all the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)>public and private information</a> of its people, that collects this information <a href=https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/09/11-11>against their wishes</a>, that makes them more <a href=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/519336/bruce-schneier-nsa-spying-is-making-us-less-safe/>vulnerable to harm</a> in order to maintain their access, and then <a href=http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/15/lies-damned-lies-and-the-nsa/>lies</a> in order to cover up their actions is fundamentally incompatible with American democracy. The freedom to live, speak, and think in private, without <a href=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/nsa-dragnet-wider-previously-suspected-says-nyt-6C10876005>worrying</a> how a government agent might view our thoughts or try to use them against us, <em>is</em> liberty. I feel obligated to <a href=http://www.draxe.com/i-opt-out-what-you-must-know-about-new-airport-backscatter-scanners/>opt out</a> and find other ways to protest and inhibit these <a href=http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2013/08/05/the-fourth-amendment-and-the-economic-spillover-from-nsa-surveillance-to-e-commerce/>destructive</a> programs.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started looking for alternatives to NSA compromised services and software and I&rsquo;m going to slowly swap them out. I used to assume that big, brand name proprietary software was more secure, now I wonder what <a href=http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/nsa_backdoor_windows.htm>backdoors</a> and vulnerabilities, <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp.aspx>known to some</a> who are trustworthy and some who are not, they contain. At least with open source software users have a fighting chance to find and address vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Email</strong></p><p>Switched from Google to self hosted. I don&rsquo;t want my personal email caught up in the NSA dragnet or any <a href=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/04/07/232224/Obama-Administration-Wants-Your-Old-Email>other dragnet</a>. I realize that if the NSA wants to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn>pwn</a> me they will, but I don&rsquo;t want to make it an any easier that I have to. I&rsquo;m still using Google Apps at work because Google Apps is awesome and I&rsquo;m less offended by the g-men snooping in that context.</p><p><strong>Search</strong></p><p>Switched from Google to <a href=http://duckduckgo.com/>DuckDuckGo</a>. They <a href=http://donttrack.us/>don&rsquo;t store</a> personal info. Their search isn&rsquo;t as good as Google&rsquo;s but I&rsquo;ll live.</p><p><strong><a href=https://lockitron.com/>Lockitron</a></strong></p><p>Cancelled my order. If you want to pick my lock you&rsquo;re going to have to show up in person.</p><p><strong>Web</strong></p><p>Switched from Google Chrome to Chromium to Firefox. Installed Adblock Plus, BetterPrivacy, Flashblock, and NoScript addons.</p><p><strong>Internet</strong></p><p>Switched to <a href=http://sonic.net/>Sonic</a> because they are the ISP available to me that <a href=https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013>fights the hardest</a> for their users&rsquo; rights. My old provider, Comcast, not so much.</p><p><strong>Chat</strong></p><p>Switched from Apple Messages to Adium. Using OTR when I can.</p><p><strong>Etc.</strong></p><p>Donating monthly to the <a href=https://supporters.eff.org/donate>EFF</a>. Wrote my <a href=http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/>congresswoman</a> asking her to vote for the <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/nsa-surveillance-amash-amendment-narrow-defeat>bill restricting NSA phone-tracking</a>. Signed the <a href=https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/pardon-edward-snowden/Dp03vGYD>petition to pardon Snowden</a>. Donated to the <a href=https://rally.org/lavabit>Lavabit defense fund</a>. Installed <a href=http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html>Little Snitch</a> to reduce monitoring from my laptop, though I still need to take more time to lock thing down properly.</p><p><strong>Todo</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m a Mac+OSX and iPhone user, look into <a href=http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/>open alternatives</a>. I occasionally use Facebook, more and more these days for authentication across web and mobile apps, is there a way to share online without permitting a big company or a government agency the same access as my family? Try out more <a href=https://prism-break.org/>Prism-Break</a> ideas. Ponder how to use encryption on top of cloud services so I can have my cake and eat it too. Need to buy a bumper sticker that says: <a href=http://www.osnews.com/story/25469/Richard_Stallman_Was_Right_All_Along>Stallman Was Right</a>.</p></div></body></html>
