to make a great photo book with Montage than any other way ever2. If you&rsquo;ve made a photo book before, you&rsquo;re uniquely qualified to notice the (stark) contrast between Montage and the other photo book making web apps out there. If you&rsquo;ve never made a photo book before because it looked like it was going to be a chore, you should take Montage for a spin, its super easy&mldr;fun even. :)</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a software engineer you might be interested in the HTML5 goodness: Montage was built in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_%28programming_language%29>Dart</a>, its one of the first production (quality), deep+complex apps in Dart that I know of. If you&rsquo;ve been wondering what Dart can do you should play with Montage. No Flash was used to build the site, I can create a Montage on my OpenBSD laptop with no propietary, binary blobs involved. It runs on mobile devices too, though it hasn&rsquo;t been optimized for them yet and we assume you have a mouse, so its more of a proof of concept to play with on mobile for now. What&rsquo;s amazing (to me at least) is that we spent almost no time on mobile support and its pretty close to a working mobile experience&mldr;for free.</p></div></body></html>
