<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/leadership.html>#leadership</a></div><p>At least one person says you should be thinking you&rsquo;ll need <a href=http://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr/>a miracle</a> to
pull off your OKRs or they aren&rsquo;t hard enough. <a href=/stables-and-volatiles-goals.html>I worry</a> that that sort of goal
feels too much like gambling to some of the folks I manage, but what&rsquo;s a better
bar for OKR difficulty?</p><p>Perhaps the goal should be to have objectives that <em>require</em> innovation to
succeed&ndash;they need to be daunting enough that you must realize a new, hitherto
unused or not yet invented technique to pull them off. I like that better&mldr;I&rsquo;m
better at thinking of innovative solutions than I am at securing miracles. I&rsquo;d
rather make my luck than be lucky.</p></div></body></html>
