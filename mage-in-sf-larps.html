<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Writing about RPGs has gotten me all misty eyed for my pen-and-paper days past. I though Id try and find a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension>Mage</a> in the Bay Area. Posted on <a href=http://sfbay.craigslist.org/act/>Craigslist</a> and the <a href="http://forums.white-wolf.com/default.aspx?g=topics&f=33">forums</a> for Mage, but I havent turned up much. After looking at the limited level of Internet chatter related to the game these day, I&rsquo;m starting to think there arent that many people playing Mage. So sad. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just have to storytell a game myself, or perhaps consider other game worlds like <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade>Vampire</a> or D&D.</p><p>I&rsquo;m finding a good amount of chatter around LARPs though. Jane has given LARPs a shot and <a href=http://www.gamegirladvance.com/2003/10/nero-nearly-killed-me.html>survived</a>. I&rsquo;ve only had one LARP experience about 4 years ago, and I didnt find it nearly as fun as pen-and-paper. My LARPs experience was similar to my MMORPG experiences so far&ndash;heavier on the interaction than the imagination. There was lots of stuff going on, cool costumes, etc., but I competed with 40 other people for prominence in the plot. Costumes and 3D rendered environments never seem to match the richness of the unrendered worlds created in my head when I&rsquo;m playing a tabletop game. I think each of these medium has their strengths, but most people still try to shoehorn the strengths of pen-and-paper RPGs into them. Perhaps they require and deserve their own gameplay paradigm. I bet that well really see them come into their own over the next 10 years.</p><p><em>Updated on October 5th, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
