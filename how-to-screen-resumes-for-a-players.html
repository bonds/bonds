<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/management.html>#management</a></div><p>Recently I was asked how I figure out whether the resume I&rsquo;m looking at belongs
to an &lsquo;A&rsquo; player or someone of a lesser grade. Here&rsquo;s what I said:</p><p>A&rsquo;s tend to list accomplishments, and they tend to have accomplishments that
really stand out, even in their hobbies. You see stuff like <em>1st place in the
Chicago Assembler Speed Competition</em> on A engineers&rsquo; resumes. Designers point
to a portfolio that you look at and go &lsquo;wow&rsquo;. Managers talk about team
transformations or compelling business outcomes. &lsquo;A&rsquo; product managers look
like CEOs&ndash;they display strong evidence of vision, leadership, and meaningful
outcomes.</p><p>B&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s focus on duties instead of accomplishments. They try to make what
they&rsquo;ve done sound bigger by emphasizing the size of the team or company, but
when you read between the lines you realize they just organize meetings and
push documents around. Not that I have anything against documents and meetings
(well, I do despise unproductive meetings), but those are a means to an end,
not an end unto themselves.</p></div></body></html>
