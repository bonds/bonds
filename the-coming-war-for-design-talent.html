<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/leadership.html>#leadership</a></div><p><img src=https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/path1_vs_path2b.png alt=9></p><p>While the <a href=http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/11/storm-clouds.html>war</a> <a href=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2167177/software-engineer-role-world-s-profession-demand-pay>rages on</a> for software engineers, I can&rsquo;t help
wondering when UX, interaction designers, and product managers are going
to <a href=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669445/how-facebook-finds-the-best-design-talent-and-keeps-them-happy>have their turn</a>. For a lot of software projects adding a
rockstar engineer can boost productivity by more than their substantial
individual contribution, but adding a rockstar designer can <em>double</em> a
team&rsquo;s output.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say, for the sake of argument, that 1 in 5 of a good designer&rsquo;s
decisions are adding value a year after they are released; let&rsquo;s say a
rockstar achieves 2 in 5. The team building what the rockstar designer
chose are happier (more of their work has an impact), their customers
are happier (better &lsquo;awesome&rsquo; to &lsquo;meh&rsquo; ratio for new features), and
<strong>they are twice as productive</strong> as measured by value to the business.</p><p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(software_development)>Velocity</a> is important, but progress in the wrong direction is only
useful inasmuch as it <a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898>helps you figure out the right direction</a>.
Some people <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs>guess</a> better than others, some people <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto>know</a> more
than others, some people can <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_pincus>read the tea leaves</a> better than
others, and all of them are going to be in increasing demand as more
companies focus on the tremendous leverage of their design talent.</p></div></body></html>
