<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Just got back from a fundraiser my friend put on for <a href=http://www.smartvoter.org/2003/11/04/ca/sf/meas/H/>Prop H</a> in San Francisco. Ammiano was funny and the vegetable dip was top rate. My friend Mel is threatening to find a way to get <a href=http://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video22637>Georgy</a> to my next <a href=http://www.forbes.com/infoimaging/free_forbes/2003/0512/127.html>movie night</a> because I said that she is cute. But I&rsquo;ve got my own campaign to think about. My campaign to land a gig with <a href=https://www.ea.com/locations/redwood-shores>EA in Redwood City</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve decided I want to work for EA. I thought I just wanted to work in the game industry, but I visited EA in Redwood last week and I was blown away. Rob Moreno, a recruiter there is a friend of a friend and he offered to show me around even though he recruits corporate and I&rsquo;m interested in game production. I just had a great time. EA&rsquo;s got a great campus and Rob really sold me on what a great place EA would be to work. It was already at the top of my list, but after meeting with him I decided to take it up a notch and begin my campaign to work at EA.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got about 10 contacts at EA so far, met mostly through friends of friends, but I have not yet really campaigned to get a job there. In fact, this will be my first campaign for a job ever. I figure with my background the front door just is not going to cut it. I&rsquo;m no John Carmack. I&rsquo;ve got to hit the pavement to get the word out that I want to work at EA, and that I&rsquo;m a good bet for them. I know that I can bring more to the table than my enthusiasm, but I dont expect anyone to take my word for itthis is a competitive industry and I&rsquo;ve got to earn my seat at the table. Time to get to work.</p><p><em>Updated on September 26th, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
