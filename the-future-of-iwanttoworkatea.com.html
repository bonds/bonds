<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>I was thinking the other day about what should happen to this domain once I land a gig at EA. What Id like to do is find someone whose trying to get a gig at EA like I was and hand the steering wheel off to them so they can add <em>their</em> experiences. I&rsquo;ll contribute advice and insight into my experience from the inside as well as help this person along. The domain would become a repository for the stories of people trying to get into the industry (and EA specifically), passing from one aspiring game person to the next. Just like the <a href=http://princessbrideforever.com/>Dread Pirate Roberts</a>.</p><p><em>Updated on October 2nd, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
