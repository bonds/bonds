<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/management.html>#management</a></div><p>I&rsquo;ve got another deck to put together. Seems like a good time to write
down the Scott Bonds Rules of Presentations:</p><ol><li>entertain your audience</li><li>do not forget to make your point</li><li>do not put text on your slides</li></ol><h2 id=entertain-your-audience>Entertain Your Audience</h2><p>This is the first rule because its the most important. When you
entertain your audience, you make them into better listeners. They are
more engaged, more open minded, and more likely to absorb and retain
your message. They are also more likely to want to hear you speak again.
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Gordon>Bing Gordon</a> reveals 1 new, significant trade secret when he speaks,
making his talks buzzworthy in addition to entertaining his audience.</p><h2 id=do-not-forget-to-make-your-point>Do Not Forget To Make Your Point</h2><p>Ever watch a brilliant ad on TV that made you LOL, but then were left
wondering what the ad was for? Yah, don&rsquo;t do that. First entertain,
second get your point across.</p><h2 id=do-not-put-text-on-your-slides>Do Not Put Text On Your Slides</h2><p>Look. I&rsquo;m lazy and pressed for time too, so I&rsquo;ll forgive you if you
break this rule. But the best presentations do not have text on the
slides&ndash;instead they use <a href=http://www.philnel.com/2010/08/08/powerpoint/>visuals</a> as emotional queues reinforcing
the words that are spoken&ndash;they do what the soundtrack does for a movie.
And see rule #1.</p></div></body></html>
