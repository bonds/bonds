<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>So I emailed Kana Ryan and she forwarded me with a nice intro to Lisa Bell. I was getting all excited that I had a good intro into the hiring manager until I emailed Toby and he told me Lisa is in HR (and therefore a gatekeeper). I did think it a bit odd that the only credit I could find for her was a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; on the Sims Online. Heh. Hopefully shell realize what a catch I am ;)I&rsquo;ll see if I can convince her by giving her a phone call or two. I&rsquo;m wondering if I should just take a stab at who the hiring manager might be and email some of the producers on the credits for the other SimCity games&mldr;</p></div></body></html>
