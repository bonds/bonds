<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>I <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss>subscribe</a> to <a href=http://www.gamegirladvance.com/>Game Girl Advance</a> and they mentioned this <a href=http://www.cruxshadows.com/>goth band</a> in an <a href=http://www.gamegirladvance.com/archives/2003/09/18/gamers_and_goths.html>article</a> about how the goth scene is full of gamers. The band was in SF Tuesday so I went to check them out and I thought they were pretty good! Theyve got their own Sims skins5 too. :) That evening, after the evening of ear blasting and all things black, I stumbled across a little gem known as 411 publishing.</p><p>This could be a real time saver: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931625212/qid%3D1064441379/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/104-7698839-5997554>all the contact info</a> for the game industry in one place. Well see how current it is. I spend a lot of time tracking down contact info when I want to get in touch with a particular person in the industry, so this could definitely be nice. 411 is affiliated with the <a href=http://www.interactive.org/>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</a>. Hmm. They are attempting to leverage the Academy of Arts and Sciences brand into the interactive space&mldr;I&rsquo;m going to email some of my contacts in the industry and see what they know about them. First time I&rsquo;ve heard of em.</p><p><em>Updated on October 1st, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken.
