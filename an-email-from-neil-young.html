<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Thursday I got an email, out of the blue, from <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=1770/">Neil Young</a>. Hes a very experienced Executive Producer at EA, judging from his rap sheet. He said he saw this web site and he offered to meet with me. I called his assistant and we set a time to meet this coming Wednesday. Totally made my day. :) I&rsquo;m going to get in touch with Erin Turner, Jordan Maynard, and John Vifian and see if theyll be around so I can stop by and say hi while I&rsquo;m at EARS.</p></div></body></html>
