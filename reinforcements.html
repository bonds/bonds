<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>A number of weeks ago I had lunch with <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,100938/>Erin Turner</a> at the Sofitel hotel near the EA campus. Come to think of it, it was labor day or something. And of course, being a producer and all, Erin was in the office that day. :) Shes leading the charge on the <a href=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/james-bond-007-everything-or-nothing>next Bond game</a> after all, and she was wrapping pre-beta. I was plunking away on the piano when she walked up and we went to grab lunch nearby.</p><p><strong>So, We Get To Chatting</strong></p><p>Erin <a href=http://etl.stanford.edu/handouts/0304_aut_speakerbio/ErinTurner.htm>started off</a> in film before co-founding and serving as CEO of <a href=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Gigabeat+Opens+Its+Gateway+to+Liquid+Audio+and+Strengthens+Its+Music...-a063320265>Gigabeat</a> at the ripe old age of <a href=http://www.stanford.edu/class/msande273/images/redHerring.pdf>24</a>. After returning to film for a short while, she decided to pitch an EA producer on an idea and ended up landing a gig as associate producer with the Bond franchise.</p><p>She told me about her adventures in the industry and we got to talking about how the game industry isnt exactly bursting with networking opportunities, though it&rsquo;s very important to know the right people in order to get stuff done. We started brainstorming a bit about what we could do to get some of the people in NoCal area together. We came up with some good ideas; I suspect well be picking up that conversation thread again.</p><p><strong>And She Introduces Me To Jordan</strong></p><p>Erin offered to put in a good word where she could in EA and told me to ping her when I got a lead. When I heard about EAP I sent her a quick email and a few days later I heard from <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,77144/>Jordan Maynard</a> who offered to help! I guess he spoke with Erin, checked out my website and thought it was cool. He said the Penny Arcade link was what pushed me over into the &ldquo;hes a real gamer&rdquo; zone. I thought I owed the PA guys a couple beers <em>before</em>. :)</p><p>Jordans got one of the sweetest roles I&rsquo;ve heard of yet. Hes a technical designer&ndash;a newer role for EA and much of the industry I suspect. He takes game engines and figures out how to design <em>fun</em> games that play to the engines strengths. The upshot of that is that fewer resources are needed to battle the technology and more are available for other aspects of making a good game and bring it to market. Jordan worked on <a href=/alice-notes.html>Alice</a> too (as did RJ)&mldr;he did a bunch of the scripting on the cut scenes. Like when the Jabberwocky smacks Alice. :)</p><p>Hes offered to help out and he knows the guys on the EAP team. He comes from a line of entrepreneurs and gamers too, his dad, <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,183/>David Maynard</a> cofounded EA (which, basically makes him a legend). Its incredibly cool of him to offer to help me out. Its just awesome to keep meeting these great people at EA.</p><p><em>Updated on October 5th, 2013</em></p><p>Some of the links were broken. I replaced them with working links to pages with the same or similar content as before.</p></div></body></html>
