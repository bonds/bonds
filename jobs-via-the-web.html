Do you know of many people who have posted for positions via the web and have had success (success meaning interviews")? Would it be better to go snail mail? Just curious as to your thoughts.</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>Most of the people I talk to got in through a friend, not through a web site. Same with meI got in through networking. If you apply via mail or web you are competing with thousands of other applicants. If your friend introduces you to the person hiring your competing against just a few.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Alan&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
