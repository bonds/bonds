<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/leadership.html>#Leadership</a></div><p><strong>Level 1</strong></p><p>No process or rules to get in the way! All we do around here is code. It&rsquo;s like
5 years old playing soccer&ndash;everyone runs straight at the ball/latest shiny
object. Yay!</p><p><strong>Level 2</strong></p><p>We have rules/principles/policies/best-practices that we <em>hope</em> (aka think) will
make us more productive, i.e. we use CI and CD! All PRs require a code review.
100% test coverage. 20% time (for innovating). We use Scrum/Kanban/Agile. We use
planning poker. We use burndown charts.</p><p><strong>Level 3</strong></p><p>We have rules that we <em>know</em> make us more productive because we continually
measure their impact and can prove it. We alter or drop rules that no longer
work. We believe that a good rule set is good enough for a healthy engineering
culture, but its not enough for a great one. To get from good to great requires
<em>data driven</em> feedback loops and continuous improvement informed by the data,
i.e. Agile + Data.</p><p><strong>Level 4</strong></p><p>Like Level 3, but we aren&rsquo;t just measuring code productivity, we&rsquo;re measuring
the profitability of our work, aka outcomes efficiency. We can use data to
demonstrate which productivity projects are worth more to the business than
which marketing/rain making projects.</p></div></body></html>
