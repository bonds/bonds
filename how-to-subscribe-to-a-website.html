Wouldn&rsquo;t that be great? The future is now! Head over to Google Reader, sign up for an account, then click the &lsquo;add subscription&rsquo; button. Type in the URL of the website you want to subscribe to and if it supports subscriptions (aka <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)>RSS</a>) you&rsquo;ll be reading their articles in seconds. Try it on all sorts of sites: works with <em>this</em> blog, newspapers, interesting discussions in forums, and plenty of other webpages.</p><p><em>Updated on September 24th, 2013</em></p><p>Google Reader is no more.
