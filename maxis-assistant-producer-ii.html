<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Just got the email that Maxis posted for an assistant producer on the SimCity series. Wow, that would be excellent&mldr;Id love to have a chance to work at Maxis (which is, btw, an EA company). I sent an email over to <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,8354/>Kana Ryan</a> whom I noticed was the exec producer on the SimCity series as of <a href=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/gameId,7999/>SimCity 4</a>. Yah, shes probably not the hiring manager, but hopefully shell be nice enough to forward it to them&mldr;I also sent an email to <a href=/the-maxis-tour.html>Toby</a> asking if he might know who over there is the hiring manager so I can address my interest to the right person. I feel its better to address a letter to a specific person rather than a generic one, wherever possible. I&rsquo;ll also submit my resume for the position through the EA jobs web site.</p><p>I just ordered a copy of SimCity 4. Figure I&rsquo;ll have time to play through it before an interview would happen. Havent played the city series much since 2000 (what can I say, I got distracted by the whole starting new companies thing). I loved the SimCity Network Edition idea. I even liked SimEarth ;). I wonder where I put that&mldr; Yup, my latest Sim is The Sims, which is pretty cool. I got see some of the new stuff Maxis is working on when I visited over there. My lips are sealed by NDA, but it looked freakin awesome.</p><p><em>Updated on October 5th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the job posting link. The page it linked to is long gone.</p></div></body></html>
