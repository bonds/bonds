One of her favorite ways to show us she cared was to cook us food&mldr;and to sneak us a cookie when mom wasn&rsquo;t looking. My great-grandma (who we called Abuelita), grandma, mother, brother, and I have all made this bread and it&rsquo;s really good.</p><p>Especially with a little warm butter spread on top. The recipe has been passed down through my family for generations and with each generation it&rsquo;s become infused with a little more love. :)</p><p><em>Updated on July 14, 2022</em></p><ul><li>Moved the story after the recipe. I don&rsquo;t like recipes blocked by a long story either.</li><li>Changed title from &lsquo;Best&mldr;&rsquo; to the actual recipe name, SEO be damned.</li><li>Added the #recipe tag.</li></ul></div></body></html>
