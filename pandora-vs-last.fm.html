<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/music.html>#music</a></div><p><img src=https://ggr_com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pandora-vs-last.fm_.jpg alt=4></p><p>They&rsquo;re both good, but <a href=http://last.fm/>Last.fm</a> wins. How can this be? Last.fm&rsquo;s
amazing powers are put on display after the break.</p><p>Last.fm can perform these amazing tricks:</p><p>** Tag (and Multitag) radio**. If you want to listen to &lsquo;piano&rsquo;
music on Pandora, you have to select a song or artist that exemplifies
&lsquo;piano&rsquo;, then vote up/down songs until Pandora figures out what you
want. On Last.fm, you can simply tell it to play a radio station
made up of music that has the &lsquo;piano&rsquo; tag. Multitag stations are
particularly powerful because you can further refine your selection,
i.e. &lsquo;piano&rsquo; and &lsquo;happy&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>More variety</strong>. After listening to similar radio stations on both
Pandora and Last.fm for 8+ hours, I noticed a lot of repeated songs on
Pandora, but no repeated songs on Last.fm.</p><p><strong>Apps</strong> (and API). Google&rsquo;s vision of the future puts the browser
at the center of the universe, so call me a luddite, but I still prefer
desktop apps for a lot of things. Last.fm has a spiffy Flash-based
player, but there are also a lot of <a href=http://osx.iusethis.com/app/everplay>desktop apps</a> that are more
pleasant to use (more stable, nicer looking, etc). Pandora, it
appears, is an entirely closed system without a publicly available
API. While developers have still found ways to <a href=http://code.google.com/p/pandoraboy/>wrap the Pandora
Flash widget</a> in apps that add some features (like Growl
notification), they leave a lot to be desired.</p><p><strong>Monthly subscription</strong>. Want to try Last.fm out for a month, no
commitment? Its easy to do. Pandora, on the other hand, only
offers their premium service in 1-year chunks. It&rsquo;s only $36, but I
still prefer Last.fm&rsquo;s bite-sized, 1 month for $3, offering.</p></div></body></html>
