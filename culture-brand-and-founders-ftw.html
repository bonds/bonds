<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/leadership.html>#leadership</a></div><p>The quality of the people and the culture of a company define its trajectory. Brand is the bank where it stores the value it creates along the way. Everything else is implementation detail.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t have great people operating in a great culture, you&rsquo;re operating on borrowed time. Maybe you get lucky and can ride that luck for a while, but unless you build a sustainable, quality culture, you&rsquo;re dying a slow (or fast) death. If you aren&rsquo;t banking your wins in your brand, its like you&rsquo;re living hand to mouth&ndash;it works fine while things are good, but bumps in the road will be painful, leading to loss of talent and an eroding culture.</p><p>With a strong team, culture, and brand, the world is your oyster. You start in books and pivot to hosting. You can start in luxury cars and extend to solar panels.</p><p>Companies that no longer have their founders are at an inherent disadvantage&ndash;the founders are the only people within the org that have the moral authority and political clout necessary to drive a strong, high quality culture and make dramatic changes to protect and grow the culture, when they are needed.</p></div></body></html>
