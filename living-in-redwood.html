Redwood City? I&rsquo;m assuming most rent an apartment but what areas are safe and but have clubs, bars, shops, etc.?</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m under the impression that the towns near Redwood City are not geared to single people under 30. The rent doesnt seem too bad$1200/mo for a 1 room apt or $700 for a room in a house. If you can afford a commute you might enjoy living in SF for roughly the same price and 30 minutes x2 each day.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Rite&rsquo;s email, I figure he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
