<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>On the schedule for today was a meeting with Neil Young, lunch with Erin Turner, and quick hellos with Jordan Maynard and John Vifian. I was hoping to get in touch with Rob Moreno and [Tara S.][1] as well, but I&rsquo;ll have to catch them next time. I just got back and I&rsquo;ve been smiling like a goofball most of the day. It was a lot of fun talking with everyone and I really dig the vibe I get when I&rsquo;m at EA. But you knew that. ;) Low down on each of these meetings to follow shortly.</p><p><em>Updated on June 8th, 2015</em></p><p>Removed link to Tara and abbreviated her name at her request.</p><p><em>Updated on October 6th, 2013</em></p><p>Switched link to Tara from her personal site (which has nothing on it these days) to her LinkedIn profile.</p></div></body></html>
