<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/code.html>#Code</a></div><p>Rake tasks contained in a gem are not automatically available to a rails app that requires the gem. Whether that&rsquo;s the right way to do things is <a href=https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/59>under debate</a>, but in the mean time there are a couple workarounds.</p><p><strong>Option #1</strong>: Use the gem as a plugin instead. Files that match the following pattern are automatically pulled in, so you&rsquo;re good to go:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p><strong>Option #2</strong>: Create a ruby file that loads the gem&rsquo;s tasks, then require the ruby file you made in your rail app&rsquo;s Rakefile. For example, if you&rsquo;ve installed the Facebooker gem and you want to use its rake tasks, you might create a file called &lsquo;facebooker.rb&rsquo; and save it to your <em>/tasks</em> directory with these contents:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Then add this line to your Rakefile:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>But as it turns out, Facebooker&rsquo;s tasks uses relative paths to get at its config file in your rails app, which won&rsquo;t work if its installed in the gem path as a gem rather than in your rails app as a plugin! So be careful with using option #2, it may not be what the gem you&rsquo;re trying to use expects.</p></div></body></html>
