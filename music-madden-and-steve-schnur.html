Can anyone offer any suggestions about how to get into an internship in this area&rsquo; I definetely see the importance of networking in this type of business, and will use that as possible assistance. I have NEVER been so excited about anything in my life, I will take any advice!</em></p><p><strong><a href=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,7086/>Ken</a> Writes:</strong></p><p>Internship is the way to go. Contact EA University and be prepared to go wherever an audio intern opening might be. I doubt there is anything left for this summer though. BTW&ndash;Mr. Schnur deals only with music licensing. SFX, dialog, and the implementation of the music are up to the team.</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Rus&rsquo; email.
