baking powder, soda, cinnamon and salt.</p><p>In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and coconut
oil on medium speed until creamy.
Add in sugar and beat on medium speed until fluffy,
about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if
needed. Add in the egg and egg yolk, beating until combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in the vanilla extract and beat until
combined again. Gradually add in the dry ingredients, beating
on low speed until just combined.
Stir in the chocolate chips with a spatula until they are evenly dispersed.</p><p>Scoop the dough into 1.5-inch rounds (I use an ice cream scoop so they are
fairly uniform in size) and freeze overnight. When ready, place
on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 18 minutes (starting
with a cold oven) at 350 F. Take out of the oven and allow to cool for
15 minutes before eating, giving the cookies time to solidify.</p><p>Adapted from <a href=https://www.howsweeteats.com/2015/02/lactation-cookies/>How Sweat Eats</a>.</p></div></body></html>
