<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>Yeay!! Last week I accepted an offer for a permanent job with EA and my first day was this Monday. I couldnt be happierI&rsquo;m working on possibly the biggest game EA&rsquo;s ever done, my boss is one of the most experienced producers in the industry, my whole team is similarly badass, and I&rsquo;m having a ton of fun. Besides the utter luck of landing a job with this team, it feels really good to have worked hard over the past 12 months towards a goal and to have reached it! Now the thank you notes, beers, phone calls, and dinner shall commence. And heres one of the first: thank you-all for taking an interest, writing emails of encouragement, offering advice, and being the best web community a guy could ask for. I&rsquo;ll do my best to return the favor by sharing my experiences and offering what I learn as I go.</p></div></body></html>
