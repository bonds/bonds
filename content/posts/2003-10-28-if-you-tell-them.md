My friend [Brian Donoho][1] (hes the guy behind the [web-based system][2] that keeps QuickLogic in business) was at a party this weekend when he bumped into a guy that works at EA in operations. He started plugging him for info on my behalf, but I think everyone was already way too into the beer part of the evening to do much good. :) Hey, you never know.

Some of the links were broken. I replaced them with working links to pages with the same or similar content as before.
