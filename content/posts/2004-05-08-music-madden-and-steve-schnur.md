**Rus Writes:**

*I am currently working towards my science degree, my goal is to attain a position in audio engineering or related field- it looks like w/ Steve Schnur is where I would want to go  Ofcourse being the biggest fan [and best player] of Madden is a good reason, but my dream career is to be part of the awesome music and/ or sound effects behind these great games that the world craves!! Can anyone offer any suggestions about how to get into an internship in this area' I definetely see the importance of networking in this type of business, and will use that as possible assistance. I have NEVER been so excited about anything in my life, I will take any advice!*

**[Ken][1] Writes:**

Internship is the way to go. Contact EA University and be prepared to go wherever an audio intern opening might be. I doubt there is anything left for this summer though. BTW--Mr. Schnur deals only with music licensing. SFX, dialog, and the implementation of the music are up to the team.
