When a software company is searching for a new CTO or VP of Engineering, 
they tend to look for either a Chief of Surgery or a Head Coach. Hiring 
the right (or wrong) one can mean the difference between success and 
failure as a company. Knowing which you are can help you choose the 
right opportunity.

The **Chief of Surgery** is one of the best, if not the best, software 
engineer at the company. Often they are career engineers with limited 
management experience. But for a small startup where getting the code 
right is critical and the CTO is 1/4 of the development team, the CoS 
offers a huge boost in productivity by setting coding standards, 
establishing the architecture, drawing the technology roadmap, and 
coding like crazy. Basketball equivalent: Michael Jordan.

The **Head Coach** is a former engineer who has spent years developing 
their people, project, and communication skills in order to bring out 
the best in their team. As a company grows and can count a number of 
highly skilled engineers among its ranks, the engineering team will 
usually include leaders who can help with coding standards and 
architecture, but its up to the Head Coach to understand and grow 
individual talent, to forge a team that's worth more than the sum of its 
parts, and to partner with the rest of the organization so the company 
builds the right software and achieves the best possible 
results. Basketball equivalent: Phil Jackson.
