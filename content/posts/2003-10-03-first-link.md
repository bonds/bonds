I thought Id Google this sitesee if it was in the search engine already. I was surprised to find a link from another blogger! Pretty cool. Wonder how he heard about the site? So far I've told so few people about itmy main avenue of exposure so far is through people who I email from the domain. They sometimes notice the address. I also 'ping' a couple blog portals to let them know I've posted something. I'm going to go email this guy and ask him. Come to think of it, I probably should start thinking about raising the sites profile now that I've got some material up.
