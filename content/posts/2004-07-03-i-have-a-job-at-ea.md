Yeay!! Last week I accepted an offer for a permanent job with EA and my first day was this Monday. I couldnt be happierI'm working on possibly the biggest game EA's ever done, my boss is one of the most experienced producers in the industry, my whole team is similarly badass, and I'm having a ton of fun. Besides the utter luck of landing a job with this team, it feels really good to have worked hard over the past 12 months towards a goal and to have reached it! Now the thank you notes, beers, phone calls, and dinner shall commence. And heres one of the first: thank you-all for taking an interest, writing emails of encouragement, offering advice, and being the best web community a guy could ask for. I'll do my best to return the favor by sharing my experiences and offering what I learn as I go.
