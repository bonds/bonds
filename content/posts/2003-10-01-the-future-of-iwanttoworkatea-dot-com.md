I was thinking the other day about what should happen to this domain once I land a gig at EA. What Id like to do is find someone whose trying to get a gig at EA like I was and hand the steering wheel off to them so they can add *their* experiences. I'll contribute advice and insight into my experience from the inside as well as help this person along. The domain would become a repository for the stories of people trying to get into the industry (and EA specifically), passing from one aspiring game person to the next. Just like the [Dread Pirate Roberts][1].

*Updated on October 2nd, 2013*

Some of the links were broken. I replaced them with working links to pages with the same or similar content as before.
