I've decided to take down the forums. It seemed that most people prefer to email me their questions directly, so I'm going to answer the choice ones in the blog. Besides, there are a ton of forums like those at the IGDA and elsewhere that are more trafficked and probably better suited to ongoing conversations on the topic of getting into the industry because they have a lot more participants. I'm taking a bunch of the posts and reformatting them as posts so we get the added benefit of having all the content searchable through a single click. I've also updated the FAQ and I'm going through and cleaning up the cobwebs around the rest of the site.

Removed the dead link to the IDGA forums.
