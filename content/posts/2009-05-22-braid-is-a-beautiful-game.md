*You had me at hello*. --Wait...I mean: *you had me at the start up screen*. --[Braid][1] would make a great screensaver, it's that neat to look at (and listen to). And for those who like side-scrollers, there's a fun, innovative game in there too. The (free) demo is worth the price of admission and then some.
