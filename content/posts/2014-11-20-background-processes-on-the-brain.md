When I'm in the middle of a hard thought problem (i.e. coding) and I
interrupt my work on the thought problem to do something else, I find it
difficult to concentrate on the something else. I think my brain is
still working on the hard thought problem in the background, sort of
like a CPU that's still processing a different job--I'm not fully
available to focus on the dinner party or new project at hand.
