I'm going to run out of hard drive space at some point.  I've got 1.5TB drives in my [Drobo][1] right now, I wonder when the 3TB drives will come out so I can just upgrade them in place for double the capacity...

First I looked up when each of the last several capacity jumps were announced.  Google news did the trick: 500MB in 2005, 1TB in 2007, 1.5TB in 2008, 2TB in 2009.

Then I plugged my data into Excel and used the 'trend' formula.

Voila.  3TB is coming out September 3rd, 2012.  And that's about [what IDC said][2].
