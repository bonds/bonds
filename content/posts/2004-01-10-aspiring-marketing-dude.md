Jason Anderson emailed a couple days ago with aspirations to land an internship in marketing at EA. Hes a marketing major with a spring internship under his belt and a strong interest in EA. I put him in touch with Tara S. (she works in marketing at EA) who graciously agreed to chat with him and see if she could help. Id be happy to send more help his way if I can, so if any of yall reading this might have some words of wisdom be sure and send me an email!
