After [lunch][1] Erin and I walked over to say hi to [Jordan Maynard][2]. Erin took off for her appearance at Stanford and Jordan sat me down and showed me what he was working on. He helps with the animation on Bond--he develops some of the custom tools they use and the capabilities are seriously ahead of the pack.

As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves--and the character moves properly, transitions and all. The animators still have to build all the moves, but the intermediary states arent a problem anymore. On top of that, hes found a way to get the number of key states for the skeletons down dramatically by using this method--for a substantial memory savings. Really brilliant stuff.

Jordan showed me some of the gameplay and it looks great. Bond can do all manner of badass stuff. I especially like how they handle aiming--I've always found aiming on a console to be frustrating compared to using a mouse on a PC. Bond aims for you, but leaves you with enough control and other gaming elements that you dont miss it at all. I looks like it allows you to focus on doing badass Bond moves and enjoying the plot of the game instead. Sweet.

I still cant quite get over what a great vibe I get from everybody I'm meeting. Jordan is cool. Erin is cool. Neil is cool. I mean, not only are they talented, theyre the kind of people I would totally hangout with *and* the kind I would like to work with (up to this point, I haven't been able to say *both* about too many people). I dont know if I'm just getting really lucky with the people I'm meeting so far or what, but its quite a pattern.

Before I took off Jordan showed me the EA manifesto from the mid-80s (or around then). I'm going to ask him to email me a copy, it looks really cool. It asks if a computer can make you cry--I think it means in a good way. ;) And I think thats the right question.
