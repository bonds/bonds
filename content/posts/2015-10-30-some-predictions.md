By 2020 OpenBSD will be in the top 25 on Distrowatch, because of an increased
interest in security. By 2025 US legislation will have shifted the cost of poor
software security practices from the consumer to the website/software maker in
the US. By 2030 all the mainstream (desktop and server) operating systems will
be open source and sponsored/supported by at least one large (for profit)
company.
