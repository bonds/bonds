Thanks for saying hello! If you have a question for me about getting a job in the game industry go ahead and email me. I'll post your email message and my reply to it so everyone can check it out and participate--if youre lucky youll get some replies from my colleagues at EA...they check out these posts on occasion.

Over time I've answered a bunch of questions and I've written on a number of topics related to getting into games. Before you email you might want to do a search on the blog to see if the answer is already there, waiting to be discovered. :) The search box is at the bottom right.

Removed the link to scott@iwanttoworkatea.com because that email address is no longer valid. If you want to email these days you can reach me at scott@ggr.com.
