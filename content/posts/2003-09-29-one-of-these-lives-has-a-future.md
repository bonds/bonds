I just applied to a couple positions with MSs Xbox team in Redmond. I know, I know they *arent* EA, but I figure I need to keep my options open. They are growing fast and they are more familiar with how to leverage my kind of biz software production experience in the game space, increasing my appeal, which is good. I've got a few friends at MS that could help me navigate the place and I've worked with them before. Could be a good step on my way to working at EA. :)
