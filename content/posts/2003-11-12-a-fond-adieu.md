Before I took off I stopped by to say hi to [John Vifian][1] and [Craig Alexander][2] to put a face with the name. I noticed that John had a [wireless Logitech joystick][3]--I've been thinking about getting one. But he says it sucks. Except when you plug it into someone elses machine, program the fire button to emulate the keypress of 'e' and then wait for your, uh, 'friend' to fly a plane while playing Battlefield: 1942. So, if you know John, and youve been ejecting out of your plane a lot lately, look for strange dongles hanging off you computer. ;)

Some of the links were broken. I replaced them with working links to pages with the same or similar content as before.
