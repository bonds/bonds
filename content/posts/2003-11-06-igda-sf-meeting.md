I attended my first IGDA SF meeting last night at the Art Institute (I have a friend that works there too). The meeting centered on a discussion of the newly released whitepaper by the [Online Games Committee][1]. John Welch of [Shockwave.com][2], Dave Rohrl of [EA Online][3], Margaret Wallace of [Skunk Studios][4], and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of [Game Developer Magazine][5]) moderating.

I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker. I finally met Liz Wakefield in person (after a few emails back and forth)--she chairs the chapter and serves as the operations manager for the IGDA. I spoke to her at [Buzz9][6] afterwards and learned that she majored in English and sorta fell into the role through her job at CMP. But shes still a big gamer. :) She was there with Susan from the GDC--shes got her hands full preparing for GDC 2004 these days.

I had this great discussion with [Bill Swartz][7], Simon (the audio guy...didnt catch his last name), and a couple others. We talked about what makes a good or a bad producer. Opinions differed by role (some people who havent worn the hat think a good one is hands off, for example), but Bill seemed to win everyone over with the idea that a good producer lays down the law when he needs to, is a strong leader, but gets out of the way when things are on track. Sounds like overlap between biz production and game production to me. :) Bill also made some good points on why EA is cool, and LucasArt (of which I'm a fan) has really not capitalized well on its opportunities. Once again I seem to have no problem bumping into EA fans.

But I havent told you much about the presentation yet, I'm already at the beer part of the evening. I'll leave you with some tidbits:

* 60 minutes of game play seems to be the maximum it should take to entice a player to upgrade to a paying, enhanced version of the game
* But a web or downloaded game must be fun within the first 60 seconds of play because the player is not very invested (i.e. he didnt pay $50) and is unlikely to spend a lot of time trying to find the fun
* Sony has shipped 1 million online adapters for the PS/2, but its a cost-center right now. They havent tried to make money on it yet, its a blind investment--they are laying foundation.
* It costs between $50k and $150k to make your average web or downloadable (non-CD) game, so it affords greater experimentation. The budget is in some cases a reflection of bandwidth constraints on the size of the game--it just doesnt make sense to spend $2m on a 2mb game.
The [Torque][8] engine is an up-and-comer. Its being sold for $100 by some rich dude who wants to give indies a better chance and hes got the money to sell this $50k tool for $100. It was the only game engine anyone mentioned without rolling their eyes.
* I'm told I will be bumping into [IgnitedMinds][9] a lot for some reason. Hmm.
