I thought it would be nice to thank everyone I met with during the course of my [interviews][1]. I learned a lot and a number of people even offered their business cards and told me to call or email if I had more questions. Thank yous are definitely in order! I was thinking about sending emails, but I decided on personalize hand-written thank you cards. I think cards convey greater appreciation and courtesy because they take more effort. I like to send them promptly too--I think it better conveys my respect and sincerity when its prompt. So, I just spent an hour writing and addressing cards to each of the 10 people I met. Now I am off to drive them to the post office so that they will begin their journey towards Redwood City first thing Saturday morning. And then some sleep. :)
