**My Reply:** 

I can think of a few things that would help anyone in high school to prepare for a career in the game industry: 

1. Get into the best college you can--the game industry is full of self-made badasses who didnt go to college, but its getting harder and harder to break-in and advance without a well-rounded education. As the games get bigger its more and more important to have people on the team who have been exposed to the industrys best-practices as well as the broad topics that a formal education offers. 

2. Sign up for an internship with a company like EA and besides that, try to get a summer job testing games. 

3. Read about the industry, play games with an eye for how they are designed, and generally learn everything you can about games. The [IGDA][1], [Sloperama][2], and [Gamasutra][3] are some good places to start. 

4. Network. Its a tired adage, but its true--your career will depend more on who you know that what you know. Get in the habit of building relationships with people, staying in touch, and being a connector.
