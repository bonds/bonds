**Stefan Writes:**

*Hey Scott, My name is Stefan Stignei and I'm going to be a sophomore next year at OSU. I'm majoring in New Media Communications and minoring in Commnunications. I'm also going to be a Resident Assistant in my hall which I'm really pumped for because I love meeting new people and would like to help them out.*

*Anyway I would love to work for a video game company. I'm going to apply for an internship at EA Games this year and I am wondering if there is anything I need to know about the work. I'm interested in Production and Marketing/Public Relations.*

**My Reply:**

What can I tell you, its a ton of fun and its a ton of work! :) Passion, energy, and an eagerness to do anything and everything in your power to help your team succeed will take you far in any profession, but its especially important to interns that want to go permanent in the game industry. I suggest you bring a great attitude, work hard, and do your best to enjoy the wild ride should you land an internship at EA. And be sure and shoot me an email when you start your internship at EA and I'll buy you lunch. :)

Removed the link to Stefan's email, I figure he doesn't want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.
