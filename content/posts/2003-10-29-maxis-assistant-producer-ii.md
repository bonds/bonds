Just got the email that Maxis posted for an assistant producer on the SimCity series. Wow, that would be excellent...Id love to have a chance to work at Maxis (which is, btw, an EA company). I sent an email over to [Kana Ryan][2] whom I noticed was the exec producer on the SimCity series as of [SimCity 4][3]. Yah, shes probably not the hiring manager, but hopefully shell be nice enough to forward it to them...I also sent an email to [Toby][4] asking if he might know who over there is the hiring manager so I can address my interest to the right person. I feel its better to address a letter to a specific person rather than a generic one, wherever possible. I'll also submit my resume for the position through the EA jobs web site.

I just ordered a copy of SimCity 4. Figure I'll have time to play through it before an interview would happen. Havent played the city series much since 2000 (what can I say, I got distracted by the whole starting new companies thing). I loved the SimCity Network Edition idea. I even liked SimEarth ;). I wonder where I put that... Yup, my latest Sim is The Sims, which is pretty cool. I got see some of the new stuff Maxis is working on when I visited over there. My lips are sealed by NDA, but it looked freakin awesome.
