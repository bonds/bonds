[Shawn Kresal][1] sent me a [review][2] of *Rules of Play*, a new book that examines games and gameplay from an academic perspective. It sounds excellent--I'm adding it to my reading list. I've also added a new blog category called "Background Reading" for the purpose of sharing with my fellow newbies my sources for a lot of the industry background info that you see showing up in these blog entries. I'll start adding them as I read them and then see about adding the stuff I've already read, at least the ones I can remember...there have been a lot. ;)

*Updated on October 9th, 2013*

Removed the link to the no-longer-in-existence background reading category. Replaced the *Rules of Play* link with one that works. Replaced the link for Shawn Kresal with one that works.
