**Ian Writes:**

*What type of classes would you recomend me to take if I'm interested in being any type of producer or tester? if there is anyone out there that is currently in production at EA or elsewhere could you please share what classes really helped you or any other advice.*

**My Reply:** 

If you want to be a tester you should own every game system you can get your hands on and play games constantly. Testers are often picked (to the best of my knowledge) for there ability and familiarity with games.

Removed the link to Ian's email, I figure he doesn't want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.
