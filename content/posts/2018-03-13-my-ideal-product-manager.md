My ideal product manager is more interested in disproving their idea than 
proving it.

They are a scientist with the humility to *expect* they'll be wrong, the 
patience to try again, and the hunger to find the truth however unaesthetic it 
may be. They are a business person, more interested in getting results than 
questing after their ideal UI or zero bugs. They are a crafts person, not an 
artist--they value utility over beauty. They are a judge, not a legislator. They 
are an anthropologist, not a therapist. They are editor, not an author.

Does this also describe my ideal CEO? No.
