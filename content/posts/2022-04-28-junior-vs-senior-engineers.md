Warning: preference-style opinions ahead, e.g. pecan pie is better than apple pie. That
said, I’ve used these opinions [in anger][1], so they may be of interest to engineers
trying to get ahead with a leader that thinks like I do.

Junior: right tool for the job
Senior: right ‘enough’ tool for the job, fewer tools better mastered

Junior: clever solution
Senior: easy to understand solution, even if a bit ugly

Junior: don’t like criticism, don’t want to look bad
Senior: want more criticism, don’t want to make a mistake that could be avoided

Junior: job is to code, meetings are bad
Senior: job is to create value, well led meetings are where I do my highest value work

Junior: this code sucks, the author was lazy and dumb, we should just throw it out and start over
Senior: this code has created huge value and its survived because it did its job, there’s probably valuable context embedded in it that I can’t see yet, what’s the best way to learn that context and leverage the existing code given where I want to go next

Junior: do my best work alone
Senior: do my best work in deep collaboration with a diverse, highly engaged team

Junior: need to spend more time refactoring
Senior: if we spend 1 day refactoring this code it will save us 10 days over the next year according to this quick model I put together

Junior: bored when I’m not learning a new tool
Senior: bored when I’m doing low impact work

Junior: never made any big mistakes, my track record is clean
Senior: made mistakes that cost over $10M, here’s what I learned

Junior: yes I’ll do it, but I’m already working 80 hours a week and I’m burning out
Senior: yes I’ll do it, but I’m handing back item number 8 on my backlog to make room, ok?

Junior: want a raise because I found out Bob makes more than me and I’m insulted
Senior: contributed $X incremental to the company’s bottom line last year according to this quick model. Does that look right to you?

Junior: performance is a secret, just between me and my manager
Senior: want my team to know what I’m working on so I can get their support and improve faster

Junior: compensation is a secret, just between me and my manager
Senior: share my comp numbers with anyone who asks, so all of us have more context to negotiate with

Junior: happy so I won’t interview anywhere else.
Senior: interview a few times a year to stay current on the market, maintain my network, and to be reminded how much I like my current job

Junior: QA is lower value work than coding, so we should hire cheaper people than me and let them do it
Senior: QA is a worthwhile safety net, but quality is my job, I’m not going to let them find bugs in MY code

Junior: if I just had more authority, I could fix all our problems
Senior: the more vulnerable I am, the better my team will be at fixing all our problems together

Junior: I’m an imposter and I’ve gotta do my best to hide it or I’ll be fired
Senior: I’m good at what I do, but there is always someone that knows more, I want to keep improving, and great teamwork is the most reliable way to bring out the best in me

Junior: need to upgrade to the newest computer, 4 of the best monitors money can buy, every year or two
Senior: I’m highly productive on my 4y old laptop, please don’t make me spend 3 days switching to a new one
