At least one person says you should be thinking you'll need [a miracle][2] to
pull off your OKRs or they aren't hard enough. [I worry][1] that that sort of goal
feels too much like gambling to some of the folks I manage, but what's a better
bar for OKR difficulty?

Perhaps the goal should be to have objectives that *require* innovation to
succeed--they need to be daunting enough that you must realize a new, hitherto
unused or not yet invented technique to pull them off. I like that better...I'm
better at thinking of innovative solutions than I am at securing miracles. I'd
rather make my luck than be lucky.
