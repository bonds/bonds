My friend [Auren Hoffman][1] just sent me a copy of [Games 411][2] out of the blue. Nice! I was [planning][3] on getting this. Turns out the publisher is Andrew Boer. He used to be the VP of Sales for BridgePath (a company I cofounded in 1997, [acquired][4] in 2002) before he left to get his MBA over at Harvard. I wonder how he came to be involved with this project
