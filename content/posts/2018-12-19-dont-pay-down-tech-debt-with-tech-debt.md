title: Don't Pay Down Tech Debt With Tech Debt

An anti-pattern I keep running across is trying to solve tech debt problems by 
adding a new tool to the stack. It's like planning to pay off some of your $10K 
in credit card debt by getting a new card with a $5K limit with a lower interest 
rate...but then using $1K of it pay down the old card and spending the other $4K 
on new stuff. Now you've got $14K of debt to service.

Before you switch from from your old unsexy, fragile PHP or Cobol codebase to 
Haskell, you need to fix your spaghetti code, in place, with the existing tech.  If you don't understand it well enough to do that, or if you don't have the time 
to do it, you won't be replacing the old system with your shiny new system 
either, you'll just be adding yet more technical debt to you existing pile 
of...tech debt.
