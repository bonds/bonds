There's Hagen Daz, Dryers, and a whole lot of other companies making ice cream. Coldstone's the latest craze and gelato has enjoyed a recent surge in the Berkeley, CA area. But they're all pretenders to the Double Rainbow throne.

Double Rainbow makes the best ice cream I've had outside of homemade. Gelato's great and all, but I'll take a scoop of DR over any gelato I've ever had as well. Try the chocolate chip.
