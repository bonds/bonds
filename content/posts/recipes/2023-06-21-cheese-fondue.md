Makes 2 servings.

* 100 grams Swiss cheese, shredded
* 100 grams Gruyere cheese, shredded
* 1 tsp cornstarch
* 1 garlic clove, peeled
* 0.25 cup dry white wine
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 1 tsp cherry brandy
* 0.25 tsp dry mustard
* tiny pinch of nutmeg
* 1 small, round loaf of sourdough bread

In a small bowl, coat the cheeses with cornstarch and set aside. Rub the inside of an induction compatible pot with the garlic, then discard (the garlic, not the pot :).

Set the cooktop to 150 F, add the wine and lemon juice, and bring to a gentle simmer. Gradually stir the cheese into the simmering liquid, a handful at a time--melting the cheese gradually encourages a smooth fondue. Once smooth, stir in cherry brandy, mustard and nutmeg. Reduce to 140 F.

Carve the bread into 1 inch cubes, removing and discarding the crust. Stab a piece of bread with a fondue fork, dip in the fondue, and enjoy!
