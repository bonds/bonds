Makes 16 servings.

### Base

* 4 cups whole milk
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 5 large egg yolks
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 0.25 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 8 ounces (1 package) room temperature cream cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes

Combine cream and milk in double boiler.
Heat, stirring occassionally, until mixture is steaming steadily,
about 10 minutes, 175 F.

While cream mixture heats,
in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment,
add the egg yolks and sugar.
Whisk on medium speed until the mixture thickens and becomes pale yellow,
about 5 minutes.

With the mixer on low speed,
slowly pour 2 cups heated cream mixture into the mixer.
Return mixture to double boiler and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens,
about 7 minutes, 180 F.
Remove from heat.
Continue stirring constantly for 5 more minutes.
Let cool until no longer steaming, about 10 more minutes.
Stir in the vanilla extract and the cinnamon.

Return the custard to the stand mixer.
Add the cream cheese and whisk on medium speed until well combined.
It's okay if a few small pieces of cream cheese remain.
Cover the mixture with plastic wrap.
Refridgerate overnight.

### Carrot Mixture

* 1 cup brown sugar, packed
* 4 tablespoons (0.5 bar) unsalted butter
* 1.5 cups grated carrot
* 0.5 cup golden raisins
* 1 cup toasted walnuts, coarsely chopped
* 2 teaspoons dark rum

In a medium skillet over medium-low heat,
combine the brown sugar and butter.
Stir continuously until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved.
Stir in the carrots and raisins.
Continue to cook, stirring frequently until the syrup thickens,
and the carrots and raisins are coated, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.
As the mixture cools, stir occasionally to break up and distribute
all the bits evenly.
Stir in the rum and walnuts.

### Ice Cream

Turn on ice cream maker and wait until its cold.
Take custard mixture out of refridgerator and stir to get an even texture.
Pour half of the mixture into the ice cream maker,
returning the rest to the refridgerator.

Once the churning ice cream mixture resembles thick soft-serve ice cream,
15-25 minutes.
Tranfer to an ice cream container.
Pour half the carrot mixture over the top.
Fold it in using a spatula, being careful not to over mix.
Freeze overnight and then serve.

Clean the ice cream maker then repeat the churning steps with the remaining
mixture from the refridgerator.
