### Bread Machine Variant

Makes 1 loaf. This method is *way* easier than the original,
which you can find right after this one.

* 0.75 cup whole milk
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 0.5 teaspoon lemon extract
* 0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 600 grams bread flour / 3.5 cups
* 0.5 cups sugar
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 1 stick butter
* 1 package of yeast
* 0.75 cups golden raisins

Put all the ingredients, up to and including the butter,
into the bread maker, in the order they are listed.
Make a small hole in the flour,
taking care not to go so deep as to get to the liquid.
Pour the yeast in the small hole, where it will stay dry.
Set the bread maker to make regular, basic bread.
Start the break maker.
When the bread maker beeps to allow mixins, add the raisins.
Once the bread is done baking, remove it from the pan
and let it cool on a rack.

My great-grandmother was warm, fun, and loving.
One of her favorite ways to show us she cared was to cook us food...
and to sneak us a cookie when mom wasn't looking.
My great-grandma (who we called Abuelita), grandma, mother, brother,
and I have all made this bread and it's really good.

Especially with a little warm butter spread on top.
The recipe has been passed down through my family for generations
and with each generation it's become infused with a little more love. :)
