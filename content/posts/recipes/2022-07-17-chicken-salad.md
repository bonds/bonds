Supper Salad Arrives in a Pastry Boat

** Pastry Boat

2/3 cup water
5 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs

In a 2-quart pan, combine the water, butter, and salt.  Quickly bring to a boil, stirring to melt butter.  Add flour all at once, remove pan from heat, and beat ingredients with a wire whip until smooth.  Beat in eggs, one at a time, until mixture is smooth and glossy.  Spoon into a greased 9-inch cheescake pan with a removable bottom or spring-release side.  Spread evenly inside pan.

Bake crust in a 400 F oven for 40 minutes or until puffed and brown.  Turn off oven.  Prick with a wooden pick in 10 to 12 places and leave in closed oven for about 10 minutes to dry, then remove pan from oven and cool completely.  Remove crust from pan.

If you make the pastly boat a day ahead, cover looly with foil and tore at room temperature.  For longer storage, wrap completely in foil and freeze.  Thaw completely, then recrisp pastry uncovered in a 400 F oven for 10 minutes.  (Recrisp even if stored at room temperature.)  Cool, then add the salad of your choice and garnish.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

** Chicken an pod pea salad

3 cups cooked, diced chicken
1 8oz can of sliced water chestnuts, drained
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion
2 hard boiled eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 lime
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 pound edible pod-peas
1/4 cup of fresh coriander or parsley

Combine 3 cups cooked chicken (in bite-size pieces), 1 can (8 oz) water chestnuts (drained and sliced), 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion, and 2 hard boiled eggs (coarsely chopped).  In a small bowl, stir together 1 cup sour cream, 1 teaspoon lime juice, 2 teaspoons sugar, 2 teaspoons curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger.  Pour dressing over chicken mixture and mix well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and chill up to 24 hours.

** Assembly of the Boat and the Salad

Remove tips and strings from 1/4 pound edible-pod peas.  Drop into a pan of rapidly boiling water and boil for 1.5 minutes.  Drain, plunge into cold water, and drain again.  Cover and chill if cooked ahead.

To serve, arrange pod peas in bottom and up the sides of the pastry boat.  Pile chicken salad on top and garnish with fresh coriander (cilantro) or parsley.
