Makes 12 servings.

### Filling

* 0.5 pound shrimp
* 1 teaspoon dry sherry
* 0.5 teaspoon cornstarch
* 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs
* 4 tablespoons avocado oil
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 pound (mung) bean sprouts
* 2 cups celery
* 5 stalks green onion

Mix shrimp with sherry, cornstarch and 0.5 teaspoon salt.
Stir fry for 1 minute then set aside.

If chicken is used, stir fry in 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce,
and 1 teaspoon sugar.

Dice celery. Cut onions into 1-inch pieces.
Stir fry everything for 1 minute.
Sprinkle with salt, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon sugar.
Mix well.
Cool mixture completely.

### Rolling

* 1 pound egg roll wrapper or lumpia wrapper
* 1 tablespoon flour
* 2 tablespoons water
* avocado oil

Wrap egg roll with about 4 tablepoons of filling.
If using egg roll wrapper, seal with water.
If using lumpia wrapper, seal with mix flour and water in a small bowl and seal with that.

Cook or freeze immediately after rolling, otherwise the liquid
in the roll will dissolve the wrapper.

### Frying

Fill deep frier with avocado oil and heat to 356 F.
Deep fry egg rolls until golden brown.
Serve hot or keep in 200 F oven until ready to eat.

### Freezing

Place rolls on parchment paper on a baking sheet, spacing them out so they
don't touch. Once frozen, consolidate rolls into 1-gallon Ziploc
freezer bags.
