I have never liked Brussels sprouts, in fact I was generally vegetable
averse growing up. It turns out it wasn't entirely the vegetables' fault.
This easy recipe can transform Brussels sprouts from being in the dreaded
'tastes like it's good for you' category to the 'wow, can I have some
more' category while remaining very healthy.
