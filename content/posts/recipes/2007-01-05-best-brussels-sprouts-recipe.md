I have never liked brussel sprouts, in fact I was generally vegetable averse growing up. It turns out it wasn't entirely the vegetables' fault.

This easy recipe can transform brussel sprouts from being in the dreaded 'tastes like it's good for you' category to the 'wow, can I have some more' category while remaining very healthy.Michele Bonds' Brussel SproutsBuy as many brussel sprouts as you want to eatCut them in half lengthwise, so that the stem is cut in halfFry them, flat side down over medium heat in grapeseed or olive oilOnce they are a crispy brown, remove them from the heatAdd salt to taste. Even a small amount will really enhance the flavor.Serve warm
