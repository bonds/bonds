Ham Hock Soup

1	ham hock
2 cups	black eye peas
4 cups	white rice

Just get one ham hock and put in a large 
pot of water with a cup or two of black-eyed peas or any other peas you 
like (experiment)- black-eyed peas is the Southern way.  Do not salt 
until soup is done as that toughens the peas and they never soften.   
Actually the ham hock is pretty salty, but I find the soup usually needs  a little salt at the end.  Just taste.  Remember you can always add more  spice, but cannot take it out if there's too much.

Simmer (low boil) for about 4 hours (pork must be cooked thoroughly 
because of trichinosis).  This soup goes great with cornbread and 
butter.  You may like to throw in a few cloves of garlic at the 
beginning and/or a couple of cloves - all tastes are different.

Probably want to make some rice to mix it with. Maybe couscous.

To defart the beans:

Before cooking the beans, soak overnight in water.  Throw out water.  Repeat.
