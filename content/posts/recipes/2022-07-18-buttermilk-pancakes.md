Makes 2 servings.

* 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 0.5 teaspoon baking powder
* 0.25 teaspoon baking soda
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 3 tablespoons sour cream
* 1 large egg
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* avocado oil spray

Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl.
In second medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk,
sour cream, eggs, and melted butter.
Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients;
gently stir until just combined (batter should remain lumpy,
with few streaks of flour).
Do not overmix.
Let batter sit for 10 minutes.

Heat 8-inch stainless steel skillet.
Spray with avocado oil.
Add a heaping spoonful of batter into the pan.
Cook until edges are set, first side is golden brown, and
bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes.
Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancake and continue to cook until
second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining oil as necessary.
Serve pancakes immediately, or transfer to 200 F, preheated oven.
