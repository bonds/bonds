* 2 vanilla beans or 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 3.5 cups heavy cream
* 2.5 cups whole milk
* 0.66 cups sugar
* 0.66 cups light corn syrup
* 0.5 teaspoons salt
* 12 large egg yolks
* 0.25 cups of bittersweet chocolate
* 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil

Cut vanilla beans in half lengthwise.
Scrape out seeds.
Combine vanilla beans, seeds, cream, milk, sugar, corn syrup, and salt in double boiler.
Heat, stirring occassionally, until mixture is steaming steadily,
5-10 minutes, 175 F.
While cream mixture heats, whisk egg yolks in a bowl.
Slowly whisk in 2 cups heated cream mixture into egg yolk.
Return mixture to double boiler and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens,
7-14 minutes, 180 F.
Remove from heat and let cool until no longer steaming,
10-20 minutes.
Remove the vanilla beans and throw them away.
Cover the mixture with plastic wrap.
Refridgerate overnight.

Turn on ice cream maker and wait until its cold.
Take mixture out of refridgerator and stir to get an even texture.
Pour half of the mixture into the ice cream maker,
returning the rest to the refridgerator.
While ice cream is churning, add chocolate and oil to a tiny pot.
Melt chocolate over very low heat, stirring occassionally.
Remove the chocolate from the heat once it's fully melted.
Once the mixture resembles thick soft-serve ice cream,
15-25 minutes, slowly dribble half the chocolate over it while it churns.
Wait 5 more minutes, then tranfer to the freezer.
Freeze overnight and then serve.

Clean the ice cream maker then repeat the churning steps with the remaining
mixture from the refridgerator.
