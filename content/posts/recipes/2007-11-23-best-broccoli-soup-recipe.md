Don't like broccoli? --Me neither. --But hold on to your soup bowls, this is a way to eat it that tastes pretty good.

Take a pound or so of broccoli. --Boil it until tender. --Throw it in a blender, add a 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup grape seed oil, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. --Blend until smooth. --Add more oil and water in the same proportions until it flows. --If you like it more soupy use more water, if you like it thicker use more oil. --Salt to taste. --I usually like it thicker. --It's not bad spread over some bread as well.
