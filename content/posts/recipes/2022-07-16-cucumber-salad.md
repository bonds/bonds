### Less-Wet Cucumbers

* 5 Persian cucumbers (aka cocktail cucumbers)
* 2 tablespoons salt

Trim the cucumbers and cut into 0.5-inch thick pieces.
Place in a small bowl.
Sprinkle with salt and toss well to coat.
Allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Rinse off salt mixture and pat dry.

### Marinade

* 1.5 tablespoons honey
* 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons mirin
* 2 teaspoons avocado oil
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce

Mix all ingredients in a [3.5 cup glass airtight container][2].
Once the cucumbers are done getting 'less wet', add them to the container
and seal it.
Shake to coat the cucumbers.
Refrigerate overnight.
Shake occassionally, if convenient.
Transfer cucumbers to a plate and serve cold.

A single batch of marinade may be reused to marinate several batches
of cucumbers.

removed the 0.5 teaspoon added salt from the marinade, there's enough salt
on the less-wet cucumbers already
