Makes about 15 cookies.

* 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
* 1.5 cups bread flour
* 5 tablespoons brewers yeast
* 3 tablespoons ground flaxseed
* 0.5 teaspoon baking powder
* 0.5 teaspoon baking soda
* 0.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 12 tablespoons organic unsalted butter
* 4 tablespoons unrefined organic virgin coconut oil
* 1.5 cups organic brown sugar
* 1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1.5 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Directions

In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, yeast, flaxseed,
baking powder, soda, cinnamon and salt.

In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and coconut
oil on medium speed until creamy.
Add in sugar and beat on medium speed until fluffy,
about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if
needed. Add in the egg and egg yolk, beating until combined,
about 3 minutes. Add in the vanilla extract and beat until
combined again. Gradually add in the dry ingredients, beating
on low speed until just combined.
Stir in the chocolate chips with a spatula until they are evenly dispersed.

Scoop the dough into 1.5-inch rounds (I use an ice cream scoop so they are
fairly uniform in size) and freeze overnight. When ready, place
on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 18 minutes (starting
with a cold oven) at 350 F. Take out of the oven and allow to cool for
15 minutes before eating, giving the cookies time to solidify.
