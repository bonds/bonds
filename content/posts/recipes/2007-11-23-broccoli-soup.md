* 1 pound broccoli
* 0.5 cups avocado or grapeseed oil
* 0.5 cups water
* 1 teaspoon salt

Boil broccoli in water for 10 minutes.
Drain water.
Transfer broccoli to blender.
Add oil, water, and salt.
Blend until smooth.
Add more salt to taste.
Add more water if you like it thinner and more soup-like.
Serve hot or cold.

Don't like broccoli? Me neither. But hold on to your soup bowls,
this is a way to eat it that tastes pretty good.
