* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 3 tablespoons sugar

* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces

and salt to simmer in medium saucepan, stirring occassionally.
As milk mixture begins to simmer, whisk egg yolks, cornstarch,
and remaining sugar together in medium bowl until smooth.
Slowly whisk 1 cup of simmering coconut milk mixture into yolk
mixture to temper, then slowly whisk tempered yolk mixture back into
remaining coconut milk mixture.
Reduce heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until mixture
is thickened and a few bubble burst to surface, about 30 seconds.
Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla.
Let mixture cool until just warm, stirring often, about 5 minutes.

Pour warm filling into cooled prebaked pie crust.
Lay sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling and
refrigerate pie until filling is chilled and set, about 4 hours.

* 1.5 tablespoons sugar
