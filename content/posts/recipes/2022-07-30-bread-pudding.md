### Pudding

* 0.66 cup golden raisins
* 5 teaspoons dark rum
* 0.75 cup granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
* 0.13 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 14 ounces challah bread, cut into 0.75-inch cubes
* 9 large egg yolks
* 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 0.75 teaspoon salt
* 2.5 cups heavy cream
* 2.5 cups milk
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Combine raisins and rum in small bowl.
Microwave until hot, about 20 seconds; set aside to cool, about 15 minutes.

Adjust oven racks to middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to
325 degrees. Combine 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and
cinnamon in small bowl; set aside.

Spread bread cubes in single layer on 2 rimmed
baking sheets. Bake, tossing occasionally, until just dry, about 15 minutes,
switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Let bread cubes
cool for about 15 minutes; set aside 2 cups.

Whisk egg yolks, remaining granulated sugar, vanilla, and salt
together in large bowl. Whisk in cream and milk until combined.
Stir in raisin mixture.
Add remaining cooled bread cubes and toss to coat.
Transfer mixture to 13 by 9-inch
baking dish and let stand, occasionally pressing bread cubes into custard,
until cubes are thoroughly saturated, about 30 minutes.

Spread reserved
bread cubes evenly over top of soaked bread mixture; gently press into custard.
Brush melted butter over top of unsoaked bread cubes. Sprinkle brown sugar
mixture evenly over top. Place bread pudding on baking sheet and bake on middle
rack until custard has just set, pressing center of pudding with finger reveals
no runny liquid, and center of pudding registers 170 degrees, 45 to 50 minutes.
Transfer to wire rack and let cool until pudding is set and just warm, about
45 minutes.

### Sauce

* 0.5 cup packed light brown sugar
* 7 tablespoons heavy cream
* 2.5 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1.5 tablespoons rum

Whisk sugar and cream together in small saucepan set over medium
heat until combined. Continue to cook, whisking frequently,
until mixture comes to boil, about 5 minutes.
Whisk in butter and bring mixture back to boil, about 1 minute.
Remove from heat and whisk in rum. Let cool until just warm.
Drizzle over bread pudding. Serve.

### Reheating

Adjust toaster oven rack to middle position.
Place a serving of
broad pudding on a toaster-oven sized baking sheet.
Toast on heat level '5'. Transfer to serving plate.

Microwave 2 tablespoons of sauce. Drizzle over reheated pudding.
Serve.
