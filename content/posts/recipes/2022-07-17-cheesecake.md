Makes 12 servings.

* 16 ounces (2 boxes) [Zwieback crackers][1] or plain biscotti
* 1.5 cup sugar
* 1 cup unsalted butter
* 32 ounces (4 bars) Philedelphia cream cheese
* 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons vanilla extract
* 8 eggs
* 2 cup evaporated milk or light cream or half & half

Take eggs, cheese, and butter out of the fridge 20 minutes before
starting (makes eggs froth more for a fluffier cheesecake; makes
butter and cheese easier to work with).

Process crackers into fine crumbs using a food processor. Mix crumbs,
4 tablespoons sugar, and butter. Press crumb mixture against bottom and
sides of 10" springform pan to form the crust. 

Adjust oven rack to the middle position. Preheat oven to 325 F.

Blend cream cheese, remaining sugar, flour, and vanilla until smooth.
Seperate eggs, storing yolks and whites in separate bowls.
Beat egg yolks until light lemon color and frothy. Beat egg whites
until stiff peaks but not dry. Fold egg yolks into cheese mixture.
Blend light cream into cheese mixture. Fold egg whites into cheese
mixture. Pour into prepared crust.

Bake for 1 hour. Stabbing middle with
butter knife should come out clean when done.
Cool completely at room temperature. Chill overnight.
Serve cold.
