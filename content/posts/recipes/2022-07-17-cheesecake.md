2x 8 oz box Zwieback crackers OR 8 oz box of biscotti without icing
1.5 cup sugar
1 cup butter
32 oz cream cheese
4 tbsp flour
2 tsp vanilla
8 eggs (separated)
2 cup evaporated milk or light cream or half & half

fits 10" springform pan

Take eggs, cheese, and butter out of the fridge 20 minutes before starting (makes eggs froth more for a fluffier cheesecake; makes butter and cheese easier to work with).

Beat crackers into fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Mix crumbs, 4 tbsp sugar, and butter. Press crumb mixture against bottom and sides of springform pan to form the crust. 

Blend cream cheese, remaining sugar, flour, and vanilla until smooth. Beat egg yolks until light lemon color and frothy. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks but not dry. Fold egg yolks into cheese mixture. Blend light cream into cheese mixture. Fold egg whites into cheese mixture. Pour into prepared crust. Bake @ 325 for 80 minutes in the middle of the oven (stabbing middle with butter knife should come out clean when done). Cool completely at room temperature. Chill 4 hours or overnight.

@1920 Belmont add 20 minutes cooking time because oven is slow to reach temperature
