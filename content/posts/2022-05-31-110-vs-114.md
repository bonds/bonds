I suspect that if you take a somewhat random group of human beings
and ask them to organize themselves in order to
allocate work and limited resources, most of the time 
they will find themselves playing a zero sum game with each other. I call
it the **+1-1=0** game.

The other game to be played is the **1+1=4** game. It's the game
of abundance, of creating a bigger pie, of win-wins that benefit everyone.
It's a lot harder to pull off.
It requires leadership and shared culture (which also requires leadership).
Our modern society is evidence it can be done.

Which game are you playing? At work? With your spouse? Which game is
your boss playing? Your boss's boss?
