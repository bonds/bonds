![a salesperson paywall][1]

These days it seems that a lot of SaaS tools are offering a free tier, one or
more paid tiers, and an 'enterprise' tier, which, unlike the other tiers, has
amazing new capabilities but no price. Or rather, the price is 'contact sales'.

That price is too high for me. I don't want to contact sales. I don't want to
waste time listening to a pitch, hearing the retail price, hearing what a great
deal they're willing to offer me off the retail price because I'm special and
there's a blue moon tonight. I don't want to email a bunch of my friends and
scour forums digging for the *real* pricing scale, to make sure I'm not getting
ripped off. I don't want a multiyear contract that keeps me paying for a service
even if its no longer right for me.

The day I need the 'contact sales' tier is the day that I look hard for
alternatives with public, pay-as-you-go pricing.
