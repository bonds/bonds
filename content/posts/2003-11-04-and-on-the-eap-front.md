Went back and forth via email yesterday with John Vifian of EA Partners. RJ said he thinks they used to be called EA Distribution, at least when he was there. RJ worked with John briefly and had a good impression. Johns a Director of Development. I believe he works for Tom Frisina...I think Rob mentioned that Tom heads up the team. John is interested in interviewing me by phone Wednesday. I'm very excited! I gotta work on my interview skills though, I havent had to interview in a while. :p I'm skimming a [book][1] on interviewing today to refresh my memory and prompt me to think about the basic kinds questions I'm likely to be asked. Actually, its given me some good ideas for resume improvements.
