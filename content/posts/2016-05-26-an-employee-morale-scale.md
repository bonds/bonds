The scale goes from low to high morale. My biggest realization of the past five
years, related to morale, is how weak a tool high comp is for driving morale.
It can make people very happy for a short time, but after that it doesn't do
much on its own--the steady state for high comp (alone) is no better than the
'passively looking' step of the scale.

1. passively looking
1. not looking
1. like the work

1. like the boss
1. like the coworkers
1. appreciated

1. doing the best work of my career
1. respected internally
1. world famous and loved by many
