Shawn Kresal sent me this article about Spike TVs video game awards show. Itll be interesting to see how well games and TV mix...I suspect it will take some trial-and-error to find a good mix. Few game makers, much like the non-actors in movies, have transformed themselves into TV--compatible celebrities so far. But hey, perhaps our day is coming!
