I feel very lucky to have been introduced to [Bing Gordon][1] by [Neil Young][2]. Bing has offered to meet with me in a week and a half where well no doubt have the chance to speak about a number of interesting topics. Id love to hear the tales he has from the [early days][3] of EAhes one of the 7 original founders from back in 1982. That makes him one of the rock stars of the industry...I can hardly believe I get to sit down with him! Its going to be awesome. I feel like I'm going up to the mountain and meeting the guru to learn who-knows-what pearls of wisdom.
