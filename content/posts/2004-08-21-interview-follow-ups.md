**Rudy Writes:**

*I was reading some stuff on your website and just want to say, it's a really cool idea. Congrats on landing the job with EA! I was wondering if I could get your opinion on something, from someone who has been through the interview process before , I really value your opinion.*

*Last week at Siggraph I dropped off my reel /resume at the EA booth. The next day they brought me in for an interview at the convention. I have no idea how many people they brought in, but I was excited nonetheless. The interview felt pretty informal and didnt last any longer than 20 min, but i felt it went well.*

*I was wondering, If they ask questions like, Which division would you prefer to work at, Do you have any salary requirements? and then they wrote down my availability date as Oct 07. Are these good signs that I may have a chance to interview with them further? or is this basic stuff they ask everyone and it doesnt mean anything. Anyway, I told them Id prefer to work at Tiburon studios in Orlando, so well see what happens, come October. =]*

*Oh yeah, I noticed on your "People I've talked to page" you had Stephanie Ross listed, thats who I talked to too. She was the one who contacted me to tell me they wanted to bring me in for an interview. I failed to get the name of the recruiter from Tiburon who I interviewed with, all I know is that it was a woman, Do you have any suggestions on how I could find it out? Should I just wait until October, or call Stephanie/Tiburon before then?*

*Any insight you could give me will be appreciated, I have some follow up questions too, so looking forward to hearing from you.*

**My Reply:**

If you have someone you can call to figure out whats going on, it's a good idea to follow up. I dont know what the questions you got indicate. I was asked similar questions for a position I did not get an offer for but I stayed in touch with my interviewers and they helped me meet other people at EA that eventually did offer me a job. Once you have a toe in the door use it!

Removed the link to Rudy's email, I figure he doesn't want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.
