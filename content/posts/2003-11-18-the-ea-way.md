While I was visiting [Jordan Maynard][1] last week, I noticed an old EA advertisement framed on his desk. It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the [company][2] and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun--we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world. Jordan was kind enough to make me a copy and I think its worth sharing. Here is the ad published in the September 1983 issue of [Scientific American][3]:
