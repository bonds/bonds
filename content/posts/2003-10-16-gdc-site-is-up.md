The GDC site has done its soft launch (ie, pre-media blitz). Its like a web beta so everyone can fix there profiles and early-birds can get a peak and register. I'm on the [QoL panel][1]...I've even got a short profile on there. A couple days ago they asked for a picture, I had to whip out the digital camera. :p

Replaced the broken link to the official GDC 2004 site with a link to an article on GDC 2004 by IGN.
