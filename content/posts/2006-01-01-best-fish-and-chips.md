My girlfriend introduced me to this joint last time we were in Malibu--I ordered a 3 piece fish and chips and [Malibu Seafood][1] gave me the biggest chunks of fried fish I'd ever seen.

I'm accustom to the frozen variety and the bar food variety of fish and chips, and let me tell you this is different. They take good, fresh, gourmet quality fish and fry it up. Add some tartar sauce and you're ready to go. Oh--and order just 2 pieces, any more and you risk an oil induced heart attack. But it tastes really good. ;)
