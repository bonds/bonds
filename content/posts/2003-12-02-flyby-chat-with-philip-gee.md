While Tara and I [chatted][1] away Philip Gee walked by and Tara quickly introduced us. Phil handles college recruiting for EA and Tara wanted to see if he might have some ideas. I've been out of college too long for his department, nevertheless he offered to fill me in on which teams he knows of that are hiring producers right now and what the calendar looks like. He pointed out that in December, after the big Christmas push in October, a lot of the teams are working on their pilots with a small team of artists and developers. They are getting ready to pitch their new project before they ramp up the entire team in Q1 on the new year. Nevertheless, there are other teams that are entirely new or are otherwise on a different calendar cycle. Good stuff! Thank you email on its way.
