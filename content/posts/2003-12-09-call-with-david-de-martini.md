I had the chance to speak to [David De Martini][1] today and tell him my story. He offered to help me land an internship since its the easiest way to get me in the door and give me a chance to prove what I can do. I asked whether I had been out of college too long, but he seemed confident he could hook me up with a position. Sweet. It will give me the chance to learn from the *inside* AND it gives me exposure to the people I want to work with. I'm looking forward to hearing back from him! I'm going to follow up in a couple weeks if I dont hear from him sooner. I wasnt clear on whether the internship he had in mind started in January or if it recruited in January to start during the summer. Youll know when I know. ;)
