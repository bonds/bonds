I started our call by updating Lisa on my conversation with Hunter Smith, and she let me know what she had found. Basically, she feels stuff has a good chance of coming together at EARS shortly and shes still waiting to hear back from the other studios. Weve decided we should touch base one more time this year and then follow up after the holidays.

Removed the link to my conversation with Hunter, I don't know where that blog post went...
