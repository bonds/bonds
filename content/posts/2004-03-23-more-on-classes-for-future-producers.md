*What would you say would be a better route if I want to get into a production role? I could take a computer game design/programming class that will mostly focus on the implementation process or take classes that revolve around operations management and business classes.*

**My Reply:**

From what I've seen all of those skills are useful to a producer, though I think you would have easier time getting a job in todays industry with programming training than with business training.

Producers have to form a clear vision of the excellent, profitable game they want to build and then they have to have the leadership and technical skills to coach a diverse team of people (including their supervisors) to build the game and make the needed tradeoffs and improvements along the way. I have yet to meet two producers with the same backgrounds...there are a lot of paths to becoming a producer, though its not a fit for the interests and abilities of everyone. But that is a different discussion.

Removed the link to Koz's email, I figure he doesn't want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.
