**Ken #1 Writes:** 

*Hi. My name is Ken. I've read about the mission of EA Trax and how it relates to the music business. I think the concept is very interesting and it has caught my attention. Can you tell me anything about the Music Dept. at EA? How would I go about applying for a job in the music dept.? I havent seen too many postings on the website.*

**[Ken #2][1] Replies:** 

Persistence and directness go along way at EA. Be clear about what you want and what you can bring to the deal. If you really want to get in you must differentiate yourself from the hundreds of others. I cant tell you how of course. My usual advice is leverage your strengths and be creative.
