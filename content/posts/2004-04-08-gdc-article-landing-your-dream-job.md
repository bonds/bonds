**Chereya Writes:** 

I found this [article][2] from the Game Developer Magazine 2003 Game Career Guide. Someone has thoughfully scanned it into a PDF and uploaded it for the rest of us to read free of charge (saves you $6!).

*Updated on October 11th, 2013*

Removed the link to Chereya's email, I figure she doesn't want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.
