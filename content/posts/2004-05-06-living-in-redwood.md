*If you're under 30 &amp; probably not making a six-figure salary at EA, where do you live? Redwood City? I'm assuming most rent an apartment but what areas are safe and but have clubs, bars, shops, etc.?*

**My Reply:** 

I'm under the impression that the towns near Redwood City are not geared to single people under 30. The rent doesnt seem too bad$1200/mo for a 1 room apt or $700 for a room in a house. If you can afford a commute you might enjoy living in SF for roughly the same price and 30 minutes x2 each day.

Removed the link to Rite's email, I figure he doesn't want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.
