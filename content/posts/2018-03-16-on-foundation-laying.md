When someone says 'we are laying a foundation for X' I take it as code for 
wasting resources and the sort of lazy thinking that goes with it...at least if 
they are talking about going dark to make some software, whether its about the 
code, infrastructure, tooling, UI, or UX. Real (successful) developers ship 
value now; rinse, repeat. You don't win a race by standing still.
