I'm excited to [pull the curtain back][1] a bit on [Montage][2]. Montage is the second salvo (after [Mosaic][3]) in our war on mediocre photo books. We spent a year crafting a simple UI that makes it easy to create fantastic looking books. It's a lot of fun--I can't wait to show it off. You can [signup][2] for the closed beta to get an early look.
