If you're in the market for a tool that syncs your email over IMAP, I recommend
you check out mbsync. On my hefty machine, offlineimap takes many minutes to
sync, all the while pegging a CPU at 100% and slowing my machine to a crawl. On
the other hand, mbsync sips 5% CPU, finishes much faster, and has no noticeable
impact on me while doing other tasks on the same machine.
