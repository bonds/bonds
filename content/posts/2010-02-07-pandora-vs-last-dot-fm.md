They're both good, but [Last.fm][1] wins. How can this be? Last.fm's 
amazing powers are put on display after the break.

Last.fm can perform these amazing tricks:

** Tag (and Multitag) radio**. If you want to listen to 'piano' 
music on Pandora, you have to select a song or artist that exemplifies 
'piano', then vote up/down songs until Pandora figures out what you 
want. On Last.fm, you can simply tell it to play a radio station 
made up of music that has the 'piano' tag. Multitag stations are 
particularly powerful because you can further refine your selection, 
i.e. 'piano' and 'happy'.

**More variety**. After listening to similar radio stations on both 
Pandora and Last.fm for 8+ hours, I noticed a lot of repeated songs on 
Pandora, but no repeated songs on Last.fm.

**Apps** (and API). Google's vision of the future puts the browser 
at the center of the universe, so call me a luddite, but I still prefer 
desktop apps for a lot of things. Last.fm has a spiffy Flash-based 
player, but there are also a lot of [desktop apps][2] that are more 
pleasant to use (more stable, nicer looking, etc). Pandora, it 
appears, is an entirely closed system without a publicly available 
API. While developers have still found ways to [wrap the Pandora 
Flash widget][3] in apps that add some features (like Growl 
notification), they leave a lot to be desired.

**Monthly subscription**. Want to try Last.fm out for a month, no 
commitment? Its easy to do. Pandora, on the other hand, only 
offers their premium service in 1-year chunks. It's only $36, but I 
still prefer Last.fm's bite-sized, 1 month for $3, offering.
