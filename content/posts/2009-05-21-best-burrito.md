They won't be serving these at the [Ritz Carlton][1] any time soon, but don't let it's commonplace appearance fool you. --[Chavez Supermarket][2] makes a--tasty--*Super Carnitas Burrito* packed with lots of pork and other burrito essentials. --But if that's not fancy enough for you, you can always ask for it 'Au Jus'.
