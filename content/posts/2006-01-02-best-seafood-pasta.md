It's not as good as [homemade][1] but [Michelangelo's][2] has had the same special for 5 years: linguini with baby clams, shrimp, and mussels; and it's really good.

The place has a fun atmosphere, there's rarely a long wait, and they serve gummy bears for desert. Oh, and if there is a wait, ask them to break you off a chunk of parmesan from their 20 lb. block of cheese or grab some yourself, it's usually near the entrance.
