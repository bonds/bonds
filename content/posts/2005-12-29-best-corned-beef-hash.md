Whenever I visit my family in the LA area I try to find my way to [Billy's in Glendale][1] for an order of corned beef hashand an order of hash brown potatoes (with plenty of ketchup). Billy's makes their own corned beef hash and it's excellent. I have tried corned beef hash at many other restaurants trying to find something this good closer to my home in San Francisco; I've searched high and low, but I've yet to find a comparable hash.
