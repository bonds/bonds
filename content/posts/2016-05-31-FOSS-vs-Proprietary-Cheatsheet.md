FOSS just gets better and better, feature-wise and ethics-wise...and it seems
Proprietary keeps getting better feature-wise, but worse ethics-wise. Its got
me asking myself why I'm not fullstack FOSS, and...its the money. I rather like
my Silicon Valley, electric car driving, Napa valley wine drinking, private
school for the kids, lifestyle. I don't see a good way to keep my life and make
FOSS software fulltime.

Here's where I think we stand today:

### FOSS

**Pros**

* largest potential audience, i.e. audience for free beer > $1 beer
* high transparency
* high developer and end user control

**Cons**

* low value capture by the authors
* low average ease of use
* lags many years behind proprietary on feature set, i.e. drivers

### Proprietary

**Pros**

* largest existing audience, i.e. Windows, iOS, Playstation > Linux,
  Replicant, MAME
* high value capture by the authors, i.e. its easier to make a living, its
  easier to get rich
* high rate of new, user facing features
* high average ease of use, i.e. most software that's easy enough for grandpa
  is proprietary

**Cons**

* vendor lockin, i.e. DRM aka a movie bought on iTunes cannot be played on
  Android, the video game publisher goes out of business and you cannot play
  the game you bought anymore
* low transparency--can and often is used to hide bad behaviour, i.e. invasive
  tracking, selling your data to others, installing ad or malware on your
  machine, hiding poor security practices
* low developer and end user countrol--you get what they give you
* high risk of unhealthy and/or [manipulative][2] treatment of users
