On the schedule for today was a meeting with Neil Young, lunch with Erin Turner, and quick hellos with Jordan Maynard and John Vifian. I was hoping to get in touch with Rob Moreno and [Tara S.][1] as well, but I'll have to catch them next time. I just got back and I've been smiling like a goofball most of the day. It was a lot of fun talking with everyone and I really dig the vibe I get when I'm at EA. But you knew that. ;) Low down on each of these meetings to follow shortly.

Switched link to Tara from her personal site (which has nothing on it these days) to her LinkedIn profile.
