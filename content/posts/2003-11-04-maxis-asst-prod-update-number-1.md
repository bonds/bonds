So I emailed Kana Ryan and she forwarded me with a nice intro to Lisa Bell. I was getting all excited that I had a good intro into the hiring manager until I emailed Toby and he told me Lisa is in HR (and therefore a gatekeeper). I did think it a bit odd that the only credit I could find for her was a "thank you" on the Sims Online. Heh. Hopefully shell realize what a catch I am ;)I'll see if I can convince her by giving her a phone call or two. I'm wondering if I should just take a stab at who the hiring manager might be and email some of the producers on the credits for the other SimCity games...
