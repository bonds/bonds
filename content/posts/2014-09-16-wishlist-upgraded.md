I moved my wishlist from Amazon to [CamelCamelCamel][1]. I use my wishlist mostly as
a check on my impulses--when I want something I add it to the wishlist instead
of buying it. It feels almost as satisfying and I haven't spent any money. Every so
often I go through my wishlist to see if I still want the stuff on there. About 3/4
of the stuff gets eliminated, the rest I eventually buy. But since there's no
urgency, I like to find a good deal first, that's where CamelCamelCamel comes in.
They monitor everything I want and let me know when the price drops below a target
I've set.
