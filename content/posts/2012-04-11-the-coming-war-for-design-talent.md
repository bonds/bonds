While the [war][1] [rages on][2] for software engineers, I can't help 
wondering when UX, interaction designers, and product managers are going 
to [have their turn][3]. For a lot of software projects adding a 
rockstar engineer can boost productivity by more than their substantial 
individual contribution, but adding a rockstar designer can *double* a 
team's output.

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that 1 in 5 of a good designer's 
decisions are adding value a year after they are released; let's say a 
rockstar achieves 2 in 5. The team building what the rockstar designer 
chose are happier (more of their work has an impact), their customers 
are happier (better 'awesome' to 'meh' ratio for new features), and 
**they are twice as productive** as measured by value to the business.

[Velocity][4] is important, but progress in the wrong direction is only 
useful inasmuch as it [helps you figure out the right direction][5]. 
Some people [guess][6] better than others, some people [know][7] more 
than others, some people can [read the tea leaves][8] better than 
others, and all of them are going to be in increasing demand as more 
companies focus on the tremendous leverage of their design talent.
