A few weeks ago we moved Mixbook.com ($25M/year) off our old, bare-metal ISP and onto AWS. After months of preparation we only needed a few hours of maintenance downtime for the final step of the move, and everything before, during, and after went smoothly. That's due (especially) to the fine work of the Mixbook DevOps Team: Robert Butler, Denis Barushev--they overcame a number of interesting and unexpected obstacles along the way, all of which they are chronicling, starting with [their first blog post][1] yesterday.
