I've been pondering Hilary Clinton's [dead brokeness][1], what she meant, and
what it means to be rich. Or rather, what a (more) useful definition might
be--one that could help predict (political) views and behaviors.

### Scott's definition of 'rich'

* top 1% of income
* owns job and/or almost no chance of being fired and/or the loss of income
from being fired would *not* have a material impact on their lifestyle

The rich and/or powerful own the system, they are [root][4], and for them the
system (the government, the law, the dominant corporations) is extremely
valuable and something to be preserved and exploited for their benefit.

The rest of us are [users and programs][3]--we are part of the system, but we
don't own it. Its usually helpful to us, but it can also turn against us, and
our ability to mitigate an attack (by root) is limited.

Bill Gates is rich and powerful. Marc Andreessen is rich. Hilary is powerful,
but not rich--she needs the income from her work to preserve her lifestyle.
Barack Obama is powerful, but not rich (before he became President he was
neither). Equipped with this definition I see some interesting patterns about
views on the NSA, Snowden, unlimited copyright, and a lot of other policies that
interest me and which I find myself on the other side from those that are allied
with or are themselves rich or powerful. Its a better predictor than political
party in a lot of cases.
