My great-grandmother was warm, fun, and loving. One of her favorite ways to show us she cared was to cook us food...and to sneak us a cookie when mom wasn't looking. My great-grandma (who we called Abuelita), grandma, mother, brother, and I have all made this bread and it's really good.

Especially with a little warm butter spread on top. The recipe has been passed down through my family for generations and with each generation it's become infused with a little more love. :)
