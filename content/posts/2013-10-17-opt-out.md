<br/>

A government with easy access to all the [public and private information][1] of its people, that collects this information [against their wishes][2], that makes them more [vulnerable to harm][3] in order to maintain their access, and then [lies][4] in order to cover up their actions is fundamentally incompatible with American democracy. The freedom to live, speak, and think in private, without [worrying][8] how a government agent might view our thoughts or try to use them against us, *is* liberty. I feel obligated to [opt out][10] and find other ways to protest and inhibit these [destructive][25] programs.

I've started looking for alternatives to NSA compromised services and software and I'm going to slowly swap them out. I used to assume that big, brand name proprietary software was more secure, now I wonder what [backdoors][21] and vulnerabilities, [known to some][20] who are trustworthy and some who are not, they contain. At least with open source software users have a fighting chance to find and address vulnerabilities.

**Email**

Switched from Google to self hosted. I don't want my personal email caught up in the NSA dragnet or any [other dragnet][7]. I realize that if the NSA wants to [pwn][22] me they will, but I don't want to make it an any easier that I have to. I'm still using Google Apps at work because Google Apps is awesome and I'm less offended by the g-men snooping in that context.

**Search**

Switched from Google to [DuckDuckGo][17]. They [don't store][9] personal info. Their search isn't as good as Google's but I'll live.

**[Lockitron][16]**

Cancelled my order. If you want to pick my lock you're going to have to show up in person.

**Web**

Switched from Google Chrome to Chromium to Firefox. Installed Adblock Plus, BetterPrivacy, Flashblock, and NoScript addons.

**Internet**

Switched to [Sonic][24] because they are the ISP available to me that [fights the hardest][5] for their users' rights. My old provider, Comcast, not so much.

**Chat**

Switched from Apple Messages to Adium. Using OTR when I can.

**Etc.**

Donating monthly to the [EFF][11]. Wrote my [congresswoman][12] asking her to vote for the [bill restricting NSA phone-tracking][13]. Signed the [petition to pardon Snowden][14]. Donated to the [Lavabit defense fund][15]. Installed [Little Snitch][18] to reduce monitoring from my laptop, though I still need to take more time to lock thing down properly.

**Todo**

I'm a Mac+OSX and iPhone user, look into [open alternatives][23]. I occasionally use Facebook, more and more these days for authentication across web and mobile apps, is there a way to share online without permitting a big company or a government agency the same access as my family? Try out more [Prism-Break][19] ideas. Ponder how to use encryption on top of cloud services so I can have my cake and eat it too. Need to buy a bumper sticker that says: [Stallman Was Right][6].
