**Kat Writes:**

*Don't ya just hate the whole salary negotiation thing!? Lets say there was a 'manager' position being filled by someone with eight years experience in the industry. What kind of salary would be reasonable with which to begin negotiations? I know theres a lot of considerations and probably a huge range; I'm just looking for a baseline to get me headed in the right direction.*

**My Reply:**

You should talk to recruiters working in the game industry. Since most game recruiters either work, have worked, or compete with EA for talent they would need to keep up-to-date on that sort of information.

Removed the link to Kat's email, I figure she doesn't want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.
