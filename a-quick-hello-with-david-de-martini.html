<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p>As <a href=/intro-to-jose-martin.html>my meeting</a> with Jose was coming to a close, in walked David De Martini. I had emailed DeMar to try and setup a meeting but we hadn&rsquo;t set anything up yet. Turns out Bing put me on his calendar to his surprise. :p Made me feel pretty cool that <a href=/lunch-with-bing-gordon.html>Bing</a> got him here on my behalf, but I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to inconvenience DeMar! He offered to reschedule since now wasn&rsquo;t a good time for him to step away and I was happy to accept. We are on for next week.</p><p>With that, another great set of meetings at EA was complete. Jenny came in and offered me the remaining food from lunch. I tried to decline the salad, but I only managed avoiding the bags of chips. :) And then off into the sunset and the 101&mldr;until next time.</p></div></body></html>
