      <description>Imagine you have a team of 5, a leader plus 4 others. The leader chooses not to contribute ideas, preferring to select from the ideas of his team. The team members are equally persuasive and generate equally good and viable ideas, but the ideas are as opposite/orthogonal/different as they can be.
The team has decided to make decisions together and fully commit to those decisions, so all their creative, persuasive, and intellectual energy operates in concert.</description>

      <description>Thank you Russell Borogove for the email with encouraging words and some very helpful insights into what its like at EA. Congratulations to my good friend Mark Schlosberg who, after working his butt off for the past months as head of the campaign, won on Prop H in SF. Good to hear from you Tara S.! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to grabbing a beer and swapping notes on the industry as soon as we find a chance.</description>

      <description>On the schedule for today was a meeting with Neil Young, lunch with Erin Turner, and quick hellos with Jordan Maynard and John Vifian. I was hoping to get in touch with Rob Moreno and [Tara S.][1] as well, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to catch them next time. I just got back and I&amp;rsquo;ve been smiling like a goofball most of the day. It was a lot of fun talking with everyone and I really dig the vibe I get when I&amp;rsquo;m at EA.</description>

      <description>Before I took off I stopped by to say hi to John Vifian and Craig Alexander to put a face with the name. I noticed that John had a wireless Logitech joystick&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about getting one. But he says it sucks. Except when you plug it into someone elses machine, program the fire button to emulate the keypress of &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; and then wait for your, uh, &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo; to fly a plane while playing Battlefield: 1942.</description>

      <description>As my meeting with Jose was coming to a close, in walked David De Martini. I had emailed DeMar to try and setup a meeting but we hadn&amp;rsquo;t set anything up yet. Turns out Bing put me on his calendar to his surprise. :p Made me feel pretty cool that Bing got him here on my behalf, but I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t want to inconvenience DeMar! He offered to reschedule since now wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good time for him to step away and I was happy to accept.</description>

      <description>Scrum Master is a greatly misunderstood and under appreciated role. On most teams I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered its taken on by the PO or its ignored entirely. I&amp;rsquo;m guilty of this sin myself and when I am not ignoring it, I&amp;rsquo;m playing scrum master across way too many teams, in addition to way too many other duties, so its not done terribly well&amp;hellip;better than nothing I suppose, but better is possible, and, I think, a good investment.</description>

      <title>A Usability Scale</title>

      <guid>http://example.org/posts/2009-05-30-a-usability-scale/</guid>
      <description>Many usability professionals focus on, well, usability. But there&amp;rsquo;s more to usability than an intuitive interface. The best stuff in our lives are pleasant, fun, even habit forming.
The Scott Bonds Usability Scale
 Unusable. Not useful or usable in any sense. Functional. Very useful, but requires instruction (manual, training, demo, etc) before a desired feature is understood. Usable. Intuitive, requires little instruction before the user is proficient. Pleasant. Using it is satisfying and enjoyable.</description>

Hey Scott, My name is Stefan Stignei and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a sophomore next year at OSU. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in New Media Communications and minoring in Commnunications. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to be a Resident Assistant in my hall which I&amp;rsquo;m really pumped for because I love meeting new people and would like to help them out.
Anyway I would love to work for a video game company. I&amp;rsquo;m going to apply for an internship at EA Games this year and I am wondering if there is anything I need to know about the work.</description>

I am interviewing for a Desktop Support position on Monday for EA Tiburon in Orlando. Is there any advice you can give me? I&amp;rsquo;ve also been told there will be a written technical assessment. I was looking at your game design questionaire and was wondering if it would reflect any of those kinds of questions.
My Reply:
I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a technical assessment since I haven&amp;rsquo;t applied for a position where it would be appropriate.</description>

      <description>American McGee must be friends with Tim Burton. I decided to drop $8 for a copy of Alice. Heck, I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to the producer and a bunch of friends have recommended the game. Took me about 20 hours to play through. The graphics were funthey set the mood of wandering through this land of dark imagination.
Excellent Interface
The music was good. The menus were excellent, starting with the startup sequence with the EA logo turning into the Cat, accompanied by light laughter turning into twisted laughter.</description>

      <description>Amazon used to have outstanding customer support. But it seems their focus is elsewhere these days. In the past I&amp;rsquo;d contact them via phone or email and someone would try to understand my issue and resolve it in my favor. But yesterday I had a phone+email exchange about a very late order that they struggled to understand and chose not to fix&amp;ndash;it seemed it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fit for their playbook, so they couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what to do except to tell me I&amp;rsquo;m out of luck.</description>

      <description>Thursday I got an email, out of the blue, from Neil Young. Hes a very experienced Executive Producer at EA, judging from his rap sheet. He said he saw this web site and he offered to meet with me. I called his assistant and we set a time to meet this coming Wednesday. Totally made my day. :) I&amp;rsquo;m going to get in touch with Erin Turner, Jordan Maynard, and John Vifian and see if theyll be around so I can stop by and say hi while I&amp;rsquo;m at EARS.</description>

      <title>An Employee Morale Scale</title>

      <guid>http://example.org/posts/2016-05-26-an-employee-morale-scale/</guid>
      <description>The scale goes from low to high morale. My biggest realization of the past five years, related to morale, is how weak a tool high comp is for driving morale. It can make people very happy for a short time, but after that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much on its own&amp;ndash;the steady state for high comp (alone) is no better than the &amp;lsquo;passively looking&amp;rsquo; step of the scale.

RJ worked with John briefly and had a good impression. Johns a Director of Development. I believe he works for Tom Frisina&amp;hellip;I think Rob mentioned that Tom heads up the team. John is interested in interviewing me by phone Wednesday. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited!</description>

Turns out there are some rather good ones available, unless your aim is showing off how much you can spend on a game system.</description>

Hi Scott, I came across your site while looking at the EA Academy site (actually I was examining the guidelines for loopholes to get in as an intern). I gotta say that it was pretty smart of you to start this site&amp;ndash;talk about a great way to get noticed by the company! Anyways, I recently graduated from Vancouver Film School as an animator. I would love to get a job at EA in animation (whether it be as a mocap operator or clean up artist, etc) but am finding it incredibly difficult.</description>

Chris: Can you describe different roles or capacities that an animator might perform in the game industry? Though my primary interest is in becoming a game designer; I am also interested in cinematic cut scene direction (I did my under grad. in film).
Can one move into game design from animation or is level design a more direct route? Would you mind describing some highlights of your career as an animator?</description>

My team handled the applications development for QuickStarts consulting practice in Northern California and I was blessed with a team of outstanding consultants. Not only could they program&amp;ndash;they were communicators who worked well with our customers.</description>

I met Michael when my friend Melinda brought him to a movie night a couple weeks ago. You worked in gaming you say? We really must talk some more. :) Turns out Michaels a real badass.

      <description>I realize that Lucas does not need my advice, not the least because I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. But that said, I was walking home from the theatre the other evening and I got to thinking about MMORPG and what can be done, taking Star Wars Galaxies as an example. You see, it had come up in an EA interview&amp;ndash;a question about why I think some game works or doesnt and then what could have been done differently, so its not purely a random fun exercise.</description>

It tastes great, it&amp;rsquo;s simple, the ingredients are inexpensive, it&amp;rsquo;s good for you, it&amp;rsquo;s great for colds (I swear fresh chicken broth has special powers, it can be made in large quantities, and it stores frozen and refrigerated.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t like broccoli? &amp;ndash;Me neither. &amp;ndash;But hold on to your soup bowls, this is a way to eat it that tastes pretty good.
Take a pound or so of broccoli. &amp;ndash;Boil it until tender. &amp;ndash;Throw it in a blender, add a 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup grape seed oil, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. &amp;ndash;Blend until smooth. &amp;ndash;Add more oil and water in the same proportions until it flows. &amp;ndash;If you like it more soupy use more water, if you like it thicker use more oil.</description>

      <description>I have never liked brussel sprouts, in fact I was generally vegetable averse growing up. It turns out it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely the vegetables&#39; fault.
This easy recipe can transform brussel sprouts from being in the dreaded &amp;lsquo;tastes like it&amp;rsquo;s good for you&amp;rsquo; category to the &amp;lsquo;wow, can I have some more&amp;rsquo; category while remaining very healthy.Michele Bonds&#39; Brussel SproutsBuy as many brussel sprouts as you want to eatCut them in half lengthwise, so that the stem is cut in halfFry them, flat side down over medium heat in grapeseed or olive oilOnce they are a crispy brown, remove them from the heatAdd salt to taste.</description>

I have tried corned beef hash at many other restaurants trying to find something this good closer to my home in San Francisco; I&amp;rsquo;ve searched high and low, but I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to find a comparable hash.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m accustom to the frozen variety and the bar food variety of fish and chips, and let me tell you this is different. They take good, fresh, gourmet quality fish and fry it up. Add some tartar sauce and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a family owned chain that&amp;rsquo;s known for it&amp;rsquo;s simple menu, good service, and excellent hamburgers (the fries are really good too).
I&amp;rsquo;ve had burgers at joints across the country, from McDonald&amp;rsquo;s to mom-and-pop burger stands and I always come back to In-N-Out. What sets In-N-Out apart from most fast food restaurants are their quality, health conscious ingredients.</description>

Double Rainbow makes the best ice cream I&amp;rsquo;ve had outside of homemade. Gelato&amp;rsquo;s great and all, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take a scoop of DR over any gelato I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had as well. Try the chocolate chip.</description>

Whatever your reason, when the time comes try these out. They are about the best mashed potatoes I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted and I&amp;rsquo;ve had quiet a few dolops of potatoes in my day.

The place has a fun atmosphere, there&amp;rsquo;s rarely a long wait, and they serve gummy bears for desert. Oh, and if there is a wait, ask them to break you off a chunk of parmesan from their 20 lb. block of cheese or grab some yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s usually near the entrance.</description>

      <description>For me there is no better spaghetti sauce that the stuff I grew up with. Period. I grew up on this stuff and maybe that&amp;rsquo;s got something to do with it, but when I make my friends have no problem polishing off a plateful and coming back for more.
My dad learned his first version of this recipe while working in an Italian restaurant in college. He made it a bunch of times while studying at Berkeley because, besides tasting great, it can be made in big batches and it refrigerates well (up to about 2 weeks).</description>

My great-grandma (who we called Abuelita), grandma, mother, brother, and I have all made this bread and it&amp;rsquo;s really good.
Especially with a little warm butter spread on top. The recipe has been passed down through my family for generations and with each generation it&amp;rsquo;s become infused with a little more love.</description>

As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves&amp;ndash;and the character moves properly, transitions and all.</description>

We used to send each email a few days after their package arrived, but we discovered that when we save up a whole bunch of the reminders, say a month&amp;rsquo;s worth, and send them all at once, it leads to more reviews, even though its the exact same number of people contacted, and for some people more time has lapsed between their order and the email.</description>

      <description>Next time you get the urge to try out some new tech in production please remember this: 5 years from now, long after you got bored with it, some poor sap is going to be stuck fixing bugs in that new tech code you committed, because no one ever took the time to rip it out, and something in production depends on it. You&amp;rsquo;ve just introduce tech debt that will most likely be wasting someone&amp;rsquo;s time for many years to come.</description>

If you want to be a tester you should own every game system you can get your hands on and play games constantly.</description>

      <description>These days it seems that a lot of SaaS tools are offering a free tier, one or more paid tiers, and an &amp;lsquo;enterprise&amp;rsquo; tier, which, unlike the other tiers, has amazing new capabilities but no price. Or rather, the price is &amp;lsquo;contact sales&amp;rsquo;.
That price is too high for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to contact sales. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time listening to a pitch, hearing the retail price, hearing what a great deal they&amp;rsquo;re willing to offer me off the retail price because I&amp;rsquo;m special and there&amp;rsquo;s a blue moon tonight.</description>

      <description>Just spoke with Tiffany Spencer of Ubisoft. She manages the PR for the Clancy series for Ubisoft&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get a hold of her for a little while. She was out of town on business and vacation, so that explains it. Pretty cool stuff though; she just had a meeting with MTV.
Tiffany noted that the Ubisoft office in SF is in fact a marketing office; though it is also home to a number of Ubisoft producers who manage relationships with their local studio partners (sorta like the role at EAP I&amp;rsquo;m interviewing for).</description>

      <description>One of the best things about System Shock 2 was the cooperative multiplayer game.
These days most games I come across are either single-player, plot-driven (games like The Sims being the exception) or multiplayer interaction-driven. And when I say single-player games are plot-driven, I mean it to include a broad range of plot complexities. Some of these plot-driven games have rather pitiful plots, i.e. Earth is being invaded by aliens and you, the last super badass are all that stands in the way of total destruction.</description>

      <description>I decided to copyright my DNA (TM). I mentioned this to my parents, and they produced a copy of the End User License Agreement (EULA) that I signed for my DNA when I was just a few seconds old, and complained of numerous violations (they still claim to be the original authors, with all visible evidence to the contrary). But, reading legal newsgroups has kept me abreast of the latest, and I knew that a contract with a minor is non-binding.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to take some notes down about the original for some time because it was a game I enjoyed and I thought it worth reflecting on why I enjoyed it as much as I did.</description>

      <description>The quality of the people and the culture of a company define its trajectory. Brand is the bank where it stores the value it creates along the way. Everything else is implementation detail.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have great people operating in a great culture, you&amp;rsquo;re operating on borrowed time. Maybe you get lucky and can ride that luck for a while, but unless you build a sustainable, quality culture, you&amp;rsquo;re dying a slow (or fast) death.</description>

      <description>Just got back from dinner with some friends from my days at QuickStart, one of which is was Matthew Chamberlain of Microsoft. He reports that hes still on the hunt at MS on my behalf (which is, of course, awfully nice of him). We got together a couple weeks ago at the MS SF office to search for people to talk to. We decided it would be a good idea to start with a couple of guys at the top (it goes something like: guys at the top-&amp;gt;studio heads-&amp;gt;exec producers-&amp;gt;producers-&amp;gt;associate producers) and go from there.</description>

      <description>Its generally thought that the ability to delay your own gratification is correlated with greater success. I buy that. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite when dealing with others&amp;ndash;giving others what they want right now and you&amp;rsquo;ll win their support, their dollars, and their vote.</description>

      <description>An anti-pattern I keep running across is trying to solve tech debt problems by adding a new tool to the stack. It&amp;rsquo;s like planning to pay off some of your $10K in credit card debt by getting a new card with a $5K limit with a lower interest rate&amp;hellip;but then using $1K of it pay down the old card and spending the other $4K on new stuff. Now you&amp;rsquo;ve got $14K of debt to service.</description>

      <description>Its amazing what you can learn from reading the SEC filings for public companies. I thought Id check out EA&amp;rsquo;s filing in June and see what I could learn about the company. Its always a great way to see where the money really is and where the company is headed, generally speaking.
So far I&amp;rsquo;ve gleaned a few interesting tidbits:
 The new EALA is going to be pretty important. EA is consolidating the old LA, Irvine, and Vegas studios into it, at substantial expense.</description>

I was introduced to Matt through my friend Ben, who is friends with Matts roommate (3 degrees). Matt worked as a mid-level QA dude on the publishers side of The Sims a few years back and he told me that EA Redwood Shores is a great place to work.</description>

I never would have guessed he knew people in the industry, but hes introduced me to Joel and to RJ Berg, a producer over at LucasArts. It just goes to show that when you are looking to meet people in the industry, tell everyone you can. You never know who all your friends of friends know.</description>

      <description>What is the point of all this?
This site exists to encourage and educate future EA employees about the roles and people of EA.
When I started looking into the game industry I couldnt find much guidance about how to make the jump coming from 10 years in another industry. So, I decided I would share my experiences and try to blaze a path for the next person. Much of the blog was written while I was in the middle of figuring out how to find a job with EA.</description>

Development Director
The DDs report to Exec Producers who report to Tom Frisina. As I understand it, DDs at EAP represent the publishers (EA&amp;rsquo;s) interests on a project by helping guide the studio EA has a partnership with; ideally to help them take a successful game and turn it into a successful franchise.</description>

He pointed out that in December, after the big Christmas push in October, a lot of the teams are working on their pilots with a small team of artists and developers.</description>

      <description>FOSS just gets better and better, feature-wise and ethics-wise&amp;hellip;and it seems Proprietary keeps getting better feature-wise, but worse ethics-wise. Its got me asking myself why I&amp;rsquo;m not fullstack FOSS, and&amp;hellip;its the money. I rather like my Silicon Valley, electric car driving, Napa valley wine drinking, private school for the kids, lifestyle. I don&amp;rsquo;t see a good way to keep my life and make FOSS software fulltime.
Here&amp;rsquo;s where I think we stand today:</description>

Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m considering changing careers but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the best way to do it. After graduating a few years ago with a doctorate in clinical psychology, I obtained a faculty position at a major university, where I now work as a clinician and researcher . While I have been successful thus far in my area of study, I have made a decision to pursue a career in game design and development.</description>

I am interested in the computer animation, game design field. My question is what is the best classes to take and what will I need to become a great future EA Games associate? What classes should I look for to make sure I am getting my monies worth?I am looking at the computer animation program and Full Sail in Orlando. But the tuition is $58,000. Is a full program like that recommended or could classes be taken at a community college or university individually?</description>

The band was in SF Tuesday so I went to check them out and I thought they were pretty good! Theyve got their own Sims skins5 too. :) That evening, after the evening of ear blasting and all things black, I stumbled across a little gem known as 411 publishing.</description>

Unfortunately I did a crappy job of presenting on the panelword to the wise: public speaking is a real skill that needs to be maintained and practiced (and a good presentation requires good prep). The roundtable went well though and we talked about some really good stuff.</description>

It was immersive&amp;ndash;the story was engaging, the sound built and maintained the mood, and the interface still is the easiest 3D RTS I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. As for the sequel it has spawned, HW2 gives a great first impression&amp;ndash;the production quality is certainly there. The graphics, interface, and sound have all taken evolutionary steps that are great to see.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s how I pulled it off.
The short version: I run a script that checks whether any mounts are missing and if possible it restores them.</description>

My connection was strong (5/5 bars on wifi) but I still had dropouts. I tried every manner of fix and none was satisfactory. Until now. I seem to have stumbled on a solution and its one I had not read about before. No doubt it won&amp;rsquo;t work for everyone because of the many different possible causes for bad connectivity to your AirTunes device of choice.</description>

Some self-important power adapters sprawl over 2 or more outlets, luxuriating without a thought for the other devices. Huge, Dubai inspired, power strips are one way to find more space, but these&amp;ndash;plug extenders leverage your existing power strip to offer each of your diva adapters their own luxury suite. &amp;ndash;Just don&amp;rsquo;t tell them that you only paid $9 for a pack of 3 (before tax+shipping), let them think you splurged.</description>

      <description>I was poking around some old Haskell code the other day, when I realized that, since switching to Vim (from Atom) I hadn&amp;rsquo;t setup the necessary plugins in Vim to get syntax checking and such for Haskell.
Seeing as Stack is the new Haskell installer hotness, I installed it and used it to install a bunch of &amp;lsquo;global&amp;rsquo; packages for use with my runghc based scripts. I installed ghc-mod and hlint, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any error messages when I messed up the syntax of my Haskell code.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard tell that the WWAN module lodged inside my laptop can give me my coordinates on planet Earth. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d see if it was true. Fortunately, a number of brave souls have blazed the path, I needed only to rediscover it.
Funny side note Did you know that your super modern WWAN module uses 1980s-era modem commands to control it? You know, AT&amp;hellip;OK, blah blah blah. Who knew, right?</description>

      <description>Rake tasks contained in a gem are not automatically available to a rails app that requires the gem. Whether that&amp;rsquo;s the right way to do things is under debate, but in the mean time there are a couple workarounds.
Option #1: Use the gem as a plugin instead. Files that match the following pattern are automatically pulled in, so you&amp;rsquo;re good to go:
  Option #2: Create a ruby file that loads the gem&amp;rsquo;s tasks, then require the ruby file you made in your rail app&amp;rsquo;s Rakefile.</description>

Rule #1: make it easy for the search engines to see and understand your content
 make as much content visible to users that are not logged in as you can&amp;ndash;search engines cannot login and they will not index any content that is behind a login barrier use descriptive names for everything, including your domains, paths, pages, and assets, i.</description>

      <description>I flashed a Lenovo x200 with Coreboot with Intel microcode enabled, ME removed, and the gigabit ethernet firmware from Libreboot. Everything seems to work with OpenBSD (my daily driver OS). Unlike with Libreboot, which comes with a Grub2 payload, Coreboot uses the SeaBIOS payload by default and it can boot an encrypted OpenBSD volume. I&amp;rsquo;m encountering what seems to be a random lockup every few days, haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to troubleshoot it yet.</description>

      <description>I looked around for an easier way to post an internal IP to DynDNS, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find one. Scripting to the rescue.
If you have a paid account at DynDNS (may work for free ones too, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure), you can update a DNS entry by hitting a URL like this:
  So, to update your DNS entry, you just need to get your IP alone in a variable that a batch file can use, then setup a task to request that URL every so often.</description>

Setup ClamAV
 Install ClamAV. I used MacPorts to install it: sudo port install clamav Make sure all the ClamAV binaries are in your PATH. Chances are if you&amp;rsquo;re using MacPorts, you&amp;rsquo;ve already taken care of that. Configure freshclam and clamd.

The old way of doing this, and the one built into Facebooker, is to publish a user action.

      <description>My friend Brian Donoho (hes the guy behind the web-based system that keeps QuickLogic in business) was at a party this weekend when he bumped into a guy that works at EA in operations. He started plugging him for info on my behalf, but I think everyone was already way too into the beer part of the evening to do much good. :) Hey, you never know.

      <description>I joined the IGDAs committee on quality of life a few weeks ago, offering to bring the newbie perspective to the table. Weve been asked to produce a white paper overviewing the state of the industry from a QoL point of view, to be unveiled at GDC 2004. The whole thing has been pretty illuminating.
I&amp;rsquo;m getting a health dose of reality from people who have come together to air the industrys dirty laundryall manner of things from unionization to reasons people leave the industry have come up.</description>

      <description>I attended my first IGDA SF meeting last night at the Art Institute (I have a friend that works there too). The meeting centered on a discussion of the newly released whitepaper by the Online Games Committee. John Welch of Shockwave.com, Dave Rohrl of EA Online, Margaret Wallace of Skunk Studios, and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of Game Developer Magazine) moderating.
I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker.</description>

      <description>Its been quite a day! 5 hours of interviews stacked back-to-back with a bunch of the EAP team&amp;hellip;and this is just the first round of in-person interviews. These were proceeded by two phone interviews a couple weeks ago. It was pretty cool meeting everyone and having the chance to ask a lot of questions about EA and the production roles here.
Craig Alexander told me the reason for the high number of interviews was that EA is very consensus oriented&amp;ndash;I will be working with a lot of people very closely under a lot of pressure and it&amp;rsquo;s important that everyone get along really well.</description>

[For internships at EA] I noticed that the applicant pool consists of about 720 students, and they only take in around 60. I had a question as to where most of these internship applications and opportunities fall . And also if 720 or so applicants consist of both high school students, current college students, and college grads.or just grads. Also, if you could tell me how many internships do they offer in the Marketing/PR department for the summer.</description>

So I walked into Tiburon, very cool building. I saw some arcade machines and stuff in this one room, it must have been the game room. I then found where I needed to go, told them I was there for the interview, and they gave me an application to fill out.</description>

We started our conversation with the standard questions about my interest in games, my favorites, etc. and then I started in with some questions of my own. I asked what makes the difference between a good producer and a great producer and he said there were three areas where a great producer excels:</description>

Hey Scott, You may have no way of gaining this info, but how effective has the web been for recruiting candidates at EA? Do you know of many people who have posted for positions via the web and have had success (success meaning interviews&amp;quot;)? Would it be better to go snail mail? Just curious as to your thoughts.

Alright, so, I&amp;rsquo;ll start off with a simple question&amp;ndash;how does one go about getting a job as a software engineer at EA? I hate to come off as arrogant, however, I have learned that this may be the only chance I have&amp;ndash;every person trying to get a job &amp;ldquo;fluffs up&amp;rdquo; their resume, advertising skills they dont really have. Thus, on a resume, I am the same as anyone else, because even though I may be honest about my skills, I look no different on a resume than someone whos fluffed theirs up.</description>

      <description>When I joined Mixbook 4 years ago, we were running very large, coarse experiments, where we&amp;rsquo;d spend 3-6 months with 2-4 people building some new feature until we thought it was done, then we&amp;rsquo;d ship. These days, we&amp;rsquo;re a bit leaner, with the same sized teams typically shipping a new experiment within 2-4 weeks. But we don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop there. Lately we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about how to get it down to 1-2 days per experiment, so we can ship 5 or more per sprint.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m under the impression that the towns near Redwood City are not geared to single people under 30. The rent doesnt seem too bad$1200/mo for a 1 room apt or $700 for a room in a house.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, after about 4 visits, that when the front desk calls someone and tells me that they have confirmed that they know I&amp;rsquo;m in 250 it can actually mean one of a few different things: a) they left a message for someone other than the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, b) they left a message for the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, c) they talked to someone who doesnt know who I am, doesnt care, and is not coming down to see me, d) they talked to the right person and they are actually coming right down.</description>

Posted on Craigslist and the forums for Mage, but I havent turned up much. After looking at the limited level of Internet chatter related to the game these day, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think there arent that many people playing Mage. So sad. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to storytell a game myself, or perhaps consider other game worlds like Vampire or D&amp;amp;D.</description>

Wow, that would be excellent&amp;hellip;Id love to have a chance to work at Maxis (which is, btw, an EA company). I sent an email over to Kana Ryan whom I noticed was the exec producer on the SimCity series as of SimCity 4.

On my hefty machine, offlineimap takes many minutes to sync, all the while pegging a CPU at 100% and slowing my machine to a crawl. On the other hand, mbsync sips 5% CPU, finishes much faster, and has no noticeable impact on me while doing other tasks on the same machine.</description>

      <description>Companies and teams tend towards mediocrity over time. Call it entropy, call it regression to the mean&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering my own sins in this area lately, and I find myself wanting.
Mediocrity is infectious and it kills motivation, creativity, and productivity. But its sooo easy. It can start with a bad hire, whose not that bad. They&amp;rsquo;ve been here for years, they are likeable, they are loyal, they&amp;rsquo;ve got outstanding raw potential&amp;hellip;but they struggle to get results.</description>

      <description>TL;DR scaling a dev team + code base has more to do with minimizing stupidity than with maximizing brilliance.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with some amount of C, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, Bourne Shell, PHP, HTML, Objective-C, Haskell, and Javascript, among others. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to imagine that the range of code quality, of an average line of code by an average engineer, using C as a sort of baseline, looks something like this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to pull the curtain back a bit on Montage. Montage is the second salvo (after Mosaic) in our war on mediocre photo books. We spent a year crafting a simple UI that makes it easy to create fantastic looking books. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun&amp;ndash;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to show it off.

      <description>Montage is now live and its 10x easier1to make a great photo book with Montage than any other way ever2. If you&amp;rsquo;ve made a photo book before, you&amp;rsquo;re uniquely qualified to notice the (stark) contrast between Montage and the other photo book making web apps out there. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never made a photo book before because it looked like it was going to be a chore, you should take Montage for a spin, its super easy&amp;hellip;fun even.</description>

What would you say would be a better route if I want to get into a production role? I could take a computer game design/programming class that will mostly focus on the implementation process or take classes that revolve around operations management and business classes.
My Reply:
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen all of those skills are useful to a producer, though I think you would have easier time getting a job in todays industry with programming training than with business training.</description>

      <description>Idris is sort of &amp;lsquo;Haskell 2.0&amp;rsquo;, where the authors got to apply the lessons learned from the creation and evolution of Haskell, but leave behind all the baggage embedded in existing, in use libraries, since, you know, they don&amp;rsquo;t have any of those yet. With the recent release of the book I was inspired to take Idris for a spin and see for myself just how lacking of &amp;lsquo;production readiness&amp;rsquo; it is.</description>

They are a scientist with the humility to expect they&amp;rsquo;ll be wrong, the patience to try again, and the hunger to find the truth however unaesthetic it may be. They are a business person, more interested in getting results than questing after their ideal UI or zero bugs. They are a crafts person, not an artist&amp;ndash;they value utility over beauty.</description>

Anyone whos written AI visual navigation/targeting systems can attest to what an impressive ability this is.

At the time (and even now) I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a ruby library that made this easy to do, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a stab at it.</description>

I worry that that sort of goal feels too much like gambling to some of the folks I manage, but what&amp;rsquo;s a better bar for OKR difficulty?
Perhaps the goal should be to have objectives that require innovation to succeed&amp;ndash;they need to be daunting enough that you must realize a new, hitherto unused or not yet invented technique to pull them off.</description>

First, I havent met many people in the game industry that choose to spend a lot of time on networking&amp;ndash;it sorta happens during the course of working in the industry but the industry is otherwise a bit insulated.</description>

      <description>Democracy and government secrets are at odds with each other. Keeping secrets and accessing the secrets of others is a way to gain power. And while we want our government to gain power over people that seek to harm us, we do not want them to have power over the innocent citizen they answer to.
The solution is transparency. The NSA must make a monthly copy of all the data and software from their systems and make it available to the public 2 years later.</description>

      <description>A government with easy access to all the public and private information of its people, that collects this information against their wishes, that makes them more vulnerable to harm in order to maintain their access, and then lies in order to cover up their actions is fundamentally incompatible with American democracy. The freedom to live, speak, and think in private, without worrying how a government agent might view our thoughts or try to use them against us, is liberty.</description>

      <description>It seems the bigots have come out of the woodwork recently, emboldened by Trump&amp;rsquo;s election. If someone behaves that way around me I&amp;rsquo;m recording a video and posting it online, for all to see. I&amp;rsquo;ll ask for their name and add it to the video&amp;rsquo;s description so its nice and easy for search engines to index.</description>

      <description>They&amp;rsquo;re both good, but Last.fm wins. How can this be? Last.fm&amp;rsquo;s amazing powers are put on display after the break.
Last.fm can perform these amazing tricks:
** Tag (and Multitag) radio**. If you want to listen to &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; music on Pandora, you have to select a song or artist that exemplifies &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo;, then vote up/down songs until Pandora figures out what you want. On Last.fm, you can simply tell it to play a radio station made up of music that has the &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; tag.</description>

EA has updated the job board on their website. I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my resume but when it shows up in the text box, a lot of my alignment is thrown off. Should I adjust it to fit the text box or leave it as it is in its MS-Word state? Which way will EA see it when I submit my resume?

Hi Kenbo, it might be easiest if you cut and paste your word document into Notepad and then format in that file.</description>

Hes working on some really interesting stuff&amp;ndash;he started in IT (got introduced to the company by a friend who was getting his masters degree in graphics) and now builds the project and asset management/project pipeline tool for PDI. Basically, he makes it easier for everyone to do their piece on a film and seamlessly pass things to the next person for the work they need to do, all the while maintaining a great deal of transparency and insight into where things are on the project.</description>

While I wasnt a fit for somewhat structural reasons I figured there were probably other areas that could use some improvement. We connected this evening and Craig buried me with help and advice!
I started the conversation with a quick recap of what I was looking for: how I could have presented myself better and what I should do to be better prepared when I interview with other groups at EA.</description>

      <description>When one is trying to increase productivity, there are 3 areas of particular interest:
 hours worked tasks completed per hour worked unit of impact per task completed  Hours Worked The company culture where you work sets the tone for how many hours you work. Startups tend to value long hours, but plenty of larger companies do too. Adding more hours can be very effective in the short-run, but in the long-run the gains can be elusive, as people shift more of their personal chores and relaxation time into their work hours in order to satisfy the expectation that they are in the office all the time, while still striking the balance that they prefer.</description>

      <description>Ruby feels like working with Legos: its easy to pickup, delightful from the start, and you can make amazing things with it quickly. But as your creations get bigger and bigger, they become increasing awkward and fragile. Using Haskell is like working with steel: its difficult to get started and takes a lot of energy to do anything, even after you&amp;rsquo;re good at it, but you can build very strong, resilient, large structures.</description>

But he did a lot more than exec produce the game&amp;ndash;he wrote the script and the dialogue while directing the voice and music.</description>

It seemed that most people prefer to email me their questions directly, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer the choice ones in the blog. Besides, there are a ton of forums like those at the IGDA and elsewhere that are more trafficked and probably better suited to ongoing conversations on the topic of getting into the industry because they have a lot more participants. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a bunch of the posts and reformatting them as posts so we get the added benefit of having all the content searchable through a single click.</description>

By 2025 US legislation will have shifted the cost of poor software security practices from the consumer to the website/software maker in the US. By 2030 all the mainstream (desktop and server) operating systems will be open source and sponsored/supported by at least one large (for profit) company.</description>

I learned a lot and a number of people even offered their business cards and told me to call or email if I had more questions. Thank yous are definitely in order! I was thinking about sending emails, but I decided on personalize hand-written thank you cards. I think cards convey greater appreciation and courtesy because they take more effort.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m working on OKRs this week and pondering whether objectives that require &amp;lsquo;just&amp;rsquo; working hard are good enough, or whether our objectives should require a miracle to pull off. Let&amp;rsquo;s say, for the sake of argument, one of our objectives has a 10% chance of success if we work on it at a normal level and a 20% chance of success if we bust our butts and pull off a couple brilliant moves.</description>

When last I was hunting for a DevOps lead, most of the folks I talked to had war/horror stories about working at a company (or two or three) where they were on duty 24x7, the codebase was fragile, they got paged a lot (at 2a), and they weren&amp;rsquo;t given the time or help they needed to dig themselves out of the hole they were hired into.</description>

      <description>Koz Writes:
Should a college student who wants to get in to the production side of video games look to take a major in say buisiness management or related buisness majors or somthing closer to computers.
My Reply:
Theres no major that maps well to production. Producers vary widely in their areas of expertise from: former artists to programmers to testers to business people. My boss is a senior producer who used to be in marketing.</description>

      <description>Like everyone else in the game industry, I too have a pet game idea or two. Having read most of the production articles at Gamasutra and much of Sloperama I realize that like most software and unlike Athena, games do not spring forth from your head fully formed. So a few weeks ago I started looking into just what it would take to build a game myself.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I find writing my own resume a challenge. On the one hand, I&amp;rsquo;m a fairly confident guy, but on the other hand, I dont really like tooting my own horn. Cant be too bold or too humble and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta speak the right language. There are certain things I need to communicate to get past the gatekeepers and make it all the way to the hiring manager and then land an interview.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we moved Mixbook.com ($25M/year) off our old, bare-metal ISP and onto AWS. After months of preparation we only needed a few hours of maintenance downtime for the final step of the move, and everything before, during, and after went smoothly. That&amp;rsquo;s due (especially) to the fine work of the Mixbook DevOps Team: Robert Butler, Denis Barushev&amp;ndash;they overcame a number of interesting and unexpected obstacles along the way, all of which they are chronicling, starting with their first blog post yesterday.</description>

I want to see what life is like without a (personal) Facebook account for a while. Seems the teenagers are doing fine (http://mashable.com/2013/08/11/teens-facebook/). I&amp;rsquo;m going to nuke my account (from orbit) this evening (it&amp;rsquo;s the only way to be sure). You can find me at https://ggr.com/ and scott@ggr.com. See you on the other side!
It was funny to see everyone&amp;rsquo;s responses.</description>

      <description>While the war rages on for software engineers, I can&amp;rsquo;t help wondering when UX, interaction designers, and product managers are going to have their turn. For a lot of software projects adding a rockstar engineer can boost productivity by more than their substantial individual contribution, but adding a rockstar designer can double a team&amp;rsquo;s output.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say, for the sake of argument, that 1 in 5 of a good designer&amp;rsquo;s decisions are adding value a year after they are released; let&amp;rsquo;s say a rockstar achieves 2 in 5.</description>

      <description>While I was visiting Jordan Maynard last week, I noticed an old EA advertisement framed on his desk. It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the company and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun&amp;ndash;we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world.</description>

      <description>We (the human race) spend/waste an enormous amount of energy writing code that won&amp;rsquo;t last. We constantly cut ourselves on the sharp edges of C, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, and lots of other languages that were the best and brightest of their day, but they don&amp;rsquo;t go far enough protecting us from our own stupidity, laziness, distractedness, busyness&amp;hellip;
Point is, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a way out of this mess. And as someone in management, I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for either doing nothing or making intentional choices about what tools galaxy my team lives in and how we go about our work of creating business value through software.</description>

      <description>While chowing down on workday lunches I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading The Hollywood Eye. It&amp;rsquo;s a book about what makes films enjoyable, moving, and generally impactful. Actually it&amp;rsquo;s the observations about what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work and why is the part most applicable to games&amp;ndash;there are a lot of ways to take the player out of the game just as there are ways to take the viewer out of a movie. Game designers have the added complication of satisfying the desires of the player without complete control over what happens.</description>

I just graduated from Cal Poly with a Computer Engineering Bachelors degree. I took a computer graphics course using java3d which I really enjoyed. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out what Id need to do to be attractive to Electronic Arts as a game programmer . I&amp;rsquo;ve been entertaining getting a masters degree in computer graphics at UC Davis, but am thinking maybe there is more straight forward approach.

      <description>Level 1
No process or rules to get in the way! All we do around here is code. It&amp;rsquo;s like 5 years old playing soccer&amp;ndash;everyone runs straight at the ball/latest shiny object. Yay!
Level 2
We have rules/principles/policies/best-practices that we hope (aka think) will make us more productive, i.e. we use CI and CD! All PRs require a code review. 100% test coverage. 20% time (for innovating). We use Scrum/Kanban/Agile. We use planning poker.</description>

And I cant even begin to tell you all the cool shit they are working on because of the NDA I had to sign before entering.</description>

      <description>Maybe its just me, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired off all the comic book evil that we have in games these days. Whether youre playing KotOR or Fable youll notice that when you decide to veer to the dark side of the force its pretty obvious that what you are doing is evil . That is to say comic book evil&amp;ndash;no grays here, pretty much anyone on the planet would judge the evil action as such.</description>

 entertain your audience do not forget to make your point do not put text on your slides  Entertain Your Audience This is the first rule because its the most important. When you entertain your audience, you make them into better listeners. They are more engaged, more open minded, and more likely to absorb and retain your message.</description>

      <description>When a software company is searching for a new CTO or VP of Engineering, they tend to look for either a Chief of Surgery or a Head Coach. Hiring the right (or wrong) one can mean the difference between success and failure as a company. Knowing which you are can help you choose the right opportunity.
The Chief of Surgery is one of the best, if not the best, software engineer at the company.</description>

Rachel was out of town when I met with EAP, otherwise I would probably have met her then, though I keep hearing her name. Anyway, Lisa has also been in touch with a couple of her Canadian counterparts too; but everyone (outside of Maxis at the moment) is hella busy hiring, so she thinks they will take a couple days to get back to her.</description>

Basically, she feels stuff has a good chance of coming together at EARS shortly and shes still waiting to hear back from the other studios. Weve decided we should touch base one more time this year and then follow up after the holidays.

Scott&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;lsquo;rich&amp;rsquo;  top 1% of income owns job and/or almost no chance of being fired and/or the loss of income from being fired would not have a material impact on their lifestyle  The rich and/or powerful own the system, they are root, and for them the system (the government, the law, the dominant corporations) is extremely valuable and something to be preserved and exploited for their benefit.</description>

      <description>Privacy Matters The freedom to speak in private is essential to democracy. The less private your conversations, the more careful you are about what you say. And being careful leads to less candor, less criticism, and less innovation. Thought and private speech are the breeding ground for new, sometimes controversial ideas. They are how we prototype, think new ideas through, refine them, and get them ready for wider distribution and discussion.</description>

      <title>Winot and My OpenBSD Wifi Adventures</title>

      <description>I run OpenBSD on my main laptop. OpenBSD doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with a Gnome-like Network Manager&amp;hellip;you are on your own to keep your laptop connected to the wifi network, to manage your wifi passwords, etc. The OS makes it easy to connect to the wireless network to be sure&amp;hellip;it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t automate away connecting to a different network at work and home and such.
So I thought, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if anyone has written a tool, and lo and behold, wiconfig is a great start, written in Bourne Shell, so it has no requirements besides OpenBSD itself.</description>

      <title>Wishlist Upgraded</title>

      <description>I moved my wishlist from Amazon to CamelCamelCamel. I use my wishlist mostly as a check on my impulses&amp;ndash;when I want something I add it to the wishlist instead of buying it. It feels almost as satisfying and I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent any money. Every so often I go through my wishlist to see if I still want the stuff on there. About 3/4 of the stuff gets eliminated, the rest I eventually buy.</description>

      <description>EA Academy recently linked to this site and the email has been coming in a bit faster&amp;hellip;and its started me thinking about what direction to take the site next. I&amp;rsquo;m working on putting up some forums so more people can check out the questions and discussions that have been happening in email and blog comments up to this point. I bet there are some people who visit this site on occasion who know a lot more than I do about breaking into the industry and might be happy to help out as well!</description>

      <description>Alan Writes:
First off, excellent site. I commend you on your creativity and tenacity in achieving your goal. Great job. | I&amp;rsquo;m a screenwriter thats had moderate Hollywood success. Moderate being defined in that I&amp;rsquo;ve sold two scripts to Hollywood production companies but nothing made (yet). I also have a background in I.T. (all areas of project life cycle). | My question is, do you know if EA employs a staff of writers?</description>
