      <description>A couple months ago my wife got locked out of Steam while trying to remember her password and we had to give up on a rare chance to play some Don&amp;rsquo;t Starve Together, um, together. It got me thinking&amp;hellip;DRM is a pain in the butt sometimes. I wonder what FOSS games are out there.
Turns out there are some rather good ones available, unless your aim is showing off how much you can spend on a game system.</description>

      <description>You had me at hello. &amp;ndash;Wait&amp;hellip;I mean: you had me at the start up screen. &amp;ndash;Braid would make a great screensaver, it&amp;rsquo;s that neat to look at (and listen to). And for those who like side-scrollers, there&amp;rsquo;s a fun, innovative game in there too. The (free) demo is worth the price of admission and then some.</description>

      <description>Not knowing what to expect, I played Passage and found myself moved (not in the U-Haul sense, the other moved)&amp;hellip;something no other video game has accomplished before or since. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much, but there&amp;rsquo;s real Art in there.</description>
