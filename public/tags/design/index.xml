      <description>Many usability professionals focus on, well, usability. But there&amp;rsquo;s more to usability than an intuitive interface. The best stuff in our lives are pleasant, fun, even habit forming.
The Scott Bonds Usability Scale
 Unusable. Not useful or usable in any sense. Functional. Very useful, but requires instruction (manual, training, demo, etc) before a desired feature is understood. Usable. Intuitive, requires little instruction before the user is proficient. Pleasant. Using it is satisfying and enjoyable.</description>

      <description>There comes a time in every professional&amp;rsquo;s career when they need a graph. Maybe they need to illustrate a usability scale, maybe its something else. Fortunately, the developers at Omni are focused on making it stupid-easy to make graphs&amp;ndash;no need to bust open Excel, dust off any math skills, or crack open a book on Photoshop to make the graph you need.
