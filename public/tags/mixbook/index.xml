      <description>I organized my first hack night recently. It was a lot of fun, Dan Schultz talked about why Dart is awesome, I met some talented engineers, and Fast Company mentioned our hack night ways in their recent coverage of hackathons.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to pull the curtain back a bit on Montage. Montage is the second salvo (after Mosaic) in our war on mediocre photo books. We spent a year crafting a simple UI that makes it easy to create fantastic looking books. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun&amp;ndash;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to show it off. You can signup for the closed beta to get an early look.</description>

      <description>Montage is now live and its 10x easier1to make a great photo book with Montage than any other way ever2. If you&amp;rsquo;ve made a photo book before, you&amp;rsquo;re uniquely qualified to notice the (stark) contrast between Montage and the other photo book making web apps out there. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never made a photo book before because it looked like it was going to be a chore, you should take Montage for a spin, its super easy&amp;hellip;fun even.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we moved Mixbook.com ($25M/year) off our old, bare-metal ISP and onto AWS. After months of preparation we only needed a few hours of maintenance downtime for the final step of the move, and everything before, during, and after went smoothly. That&amp;rsquo;s due (especially) to the fine work of the Mixbook DevOps Team: Robert Butler, Denis Barushev&amp;ndash;they overcame a number of interesting and unexpected obstacles along the way, all of which they are chronicling, starting with their first blog post yesterday.</description>
