      <description>For months I struggled with frequent audio dropouts while connecting to stereo through my Airport Express from my Mac laptop. My connection was strong (5/5 bars on wifi) but I still had dropouts. I tried every manner of fix and none was satisfactory. Until now. I seem to have stumbled on a solution and its one I had not read about before. No doubt it won&amp;rsquo;t work for everyone because of the many different possible causes for bad connectivity to your AirTunes device of choice.</description>

      <description>They&amp;rsquo;re both good, but Last.fm wins. How can this be? Last.fm&amp;rsquo;s amazing powers are put on display after the break.
Last.fm can perform these amazing tricks:
** Tag (and Multitag) radio**. If you want to listen to &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; music on Pandora, you have to select a song or artist that exemplifies &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo;, then vote up/down songs until Pandora figures out what you want. On Last.fm, you can simply tell it to play a radio station made up of music that has the &amp;lsquo;piano&amp;rsquo; tag.</description>
