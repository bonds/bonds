      <description>Saw this post over at Slashdot talking about Gaming Horizons suggestions for this Christmas season. Interesting to compare their list with the top games of the year according to Metacritic.

      <description>Thank you Russell Borogove for the email with encouraging words and some very helpful insights into what its like at EA. Congratulations to my good friend Mark Schlosberg who, after working his butt off for the past months as head of the campaign, won on Prop H in SF. Good to hear from you Tara S.! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to grabbing a beer and swapping notes on the industry as soon as we find a chance.</description>

      <description>On the schedule for today was a meeting with Neil Young, lunch with Erin Turner, and quick hellos with Jordan Maynard and John Vifian. I was hoping to get in touch with Rob Moreno and [Tara S.][1] as well, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to catch them next time. I just got back and I&amp;rsquo;ve been smiling like a goofball most of the day. It was a lot of fun talking with everyone and I really dig the vibe I get when I&amp;rsquo;m at EA.</description>

      <description>Before I took off I stopped by to say hi to John Vifian and Craig Alexander to put a face with the name. I noticed that John had a wireless Logitech joystick&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about getting one. But he says it sucks. Except when you plug it into someone elses machine, program the fire button to emulate the keypress of &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; and then wait for your, uh, &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo; to fly a plane while playing Battlefield: 1942.</description>

      <description>As my meeting with Jose was coming to a close, in walked David De Martini. I had emailed DeMar to try and setup a meeting but we hadn&amp;rsquo;t set anything up yet. Turns out Bing put me on his calendar to his surprise. :p Made me feel pretty cool that Bing got him here on my behalf, but I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t want to inconvenience DeMar! He offered to reschedule since now wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good time for him to step away and I was happy to accept.</description>

Hey Scott, My name is Stefan Stignei and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a sophomore next year at OSU. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in New Media Communications and minoring in Commnunications. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to be a Resident Assistant in my hall which I&amp;rsquo;m really pumped for because I love meeting new people and would like to help them out.
Anyway I would love to work for a video game company. I&amp;rsquo;m going to apply for an internship at EA Games this year and I am wondering if there is anything I need to know about the work.</description>

I am interviewing for a Desktop Support position on Monday for EA Tiburon in Orlando. Is there any advice you can give me? I&amp;rsquo;ve also been told there will be a written technical assessment. I was looking at your game design questionaire and was wondering if it would reflect any of those kinds of questions.
My Reply:
I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a technical assessment since I haven&amp;rsquo;t applied for a position where it would be appropriate.</description>

      <description>American McGee must be friends with Tim Burton. I decided to drop $8 for a copy of Alice. Heck, I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to the producer and a bunch of friends have recommended the game. Took me about 20 hours to play through. The graphics were funthey set the mood of wandering through this land of dark imagination.
Excellent Interface
The music was good. The menus were excellent, starting with the startup sequence with the EA logo turning into the Cat, accompanied by light laughter turning into twisted laughter.</description>

      <description>Thursday I got an email, out of the blue, from Neil Young. Hes a very experienced Executive Producer at EA, judging from his rap sheet. He said he saw this web site and he offered to meet with me. I called his assistant and we set a time to meet this coming Wednesday. Totally made my day. :) I&amp;rsquo;m going to get in touch with Erin Turner, Jordan Maynard, and John Vifian and see if theyll be around so I can stop by and say hi while I&amp;rsquo;m at EARS.</description>

      <description>Went back and forth via email yesterday with John Vifian of EA Partners. RJ said he thinks they used to be called EA Distribution, at least when he was there. RJ worked with John briefly and had a good impression. Johns a Director of Development. I believe he works for Tom Frisina&amp;hellip;I think Rob mentioned that Tom heads up the team. John is interested in interviewing me by phone Wednesday. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited!</description>

Hi Scott, I came across your site while looking at the EA Academy site (actually I was examining the guidelines for loopholes to get in as an intern). I gotta say that it was pretty smart of you to start this site&amp;ndash;talk about a great way to get noticed by the company! Anyways, I recently graduated from Vancouver Film School as an animator. I would love to get a job at EA in animation (whether it be as a mocap operator or clean up artist, etc) but am finding it incredibly difficult.</description>

Chris: Can you describe different roles or capacities that an animator might perform in the game industry? Though my primary interest is in becoming a game designer; I am also interested in cinematic cut scene direction (I did my under grad. in film).
Can one move into game design from animation or is level design a more direct route? Would you mind describing some highlights of your career as an animator?</description>

Hes had some offers from VH1 too&amp;ndash;basically hes totally kicking butt down here. We used to be roommates and before that we were involved in student government together at Cal. Aarons been making films for the absolute love of it since he was in junior high&amp;ndash;seeing him doing so well is really cool.</description>

      <description>Just came across an article about how games may improve productivity at work. It reminded me of my consulting team at QuickStart. I dubbed my team BAAD (Bay Area Applications Development) and games were allowed in the office. Heck, half the time I was on AWP duty.
My team handled the applications development for QuickStarts consulting practice in Northern California and I was blessed with a team of outstanding consultants. Not only could they program&amp;ndash;they were communicators who worked well with our customers.</description>

I met Michael when my friend Melinda brought him to a movie night a couple weeks ago. You worked in gaming you say? We really must talk some more. :) Turns out Michaels a real badass. Hes been mentoring new developers and taking on the bitch ass bugs that no one else has the guts to stare down.</description>

      <description>I realize that Lucas does not need my advice, not the least because I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. But that said, I was walking home from the theatre the other evening and I got to thinking about MMORPG and what can be done, taking Star Wars Galaxies as an example. You see, it had come up in an EA interview&amp;ndash;a question about why I think some game works or doesnt and then what could have been done differently, so its not purely a random fun exercise.</description>

      <description>After lunch Erin and I walked over to say hi to Jordan Maynard. Erin took off for her appearance at Stanford and Jordan sat me down and showed me what he was working on. He helps with the animation on Bond&amp;ndash;he develops some of the custom tools they use and the capabilities are seriously ahead of the pack.
As far as I can tell, hes working on the holy grail of character animation: hes building and tweaking a tool that allows a programmer to take a character and just tell him what to do from this inventory of moves&amp;ndash;and the character moves properly, transitions and all.</description>

I asked whether I had been out of college too long, but he seemed confident he could hook me up with a position. Sweet. It will give me the chance to learn from the inside AND it gives me exposure to the people I want to work with.</description>

I asked Ofer to tell me more about DD vs Producers at EA. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the story from a couple Producers, but Ofer is the first DD I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to sit down with.</description>

If you want to be a tester you should own every game system you can get your hands on and play games constantly.</description>

      <description>Just spoke with Tiffany Spencer of Ubisoft. She manages the PR for the Clancy series for Ubisoft&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get a hold of her for a little while. She was out of town on business and vacation, so that explains it. Pretty cool stuff though; she just had a meeting with MTV.
Tiffany noted that the Ubisoft office in SF is in fact a marketing office; though it is also home to a number of Ubisoft producers who manage relationships with their local studio partners (sorta like the role at EAP I&amp;rsquo;m interviewing for).</description>

      <description>One of the best things about System Shock 2 was the cooperative multiplayer game.
These days most games I come across are either single-player, plot-driven (games like The Sims being the exception) or multiplayer interaction-driven. And when I say single-player games are plot-driven, I mean it to include a broad range of plot complexities. Some of these plot-driven games have rather pitiful plots, i.e. Earth is being invaded by aliens and you, the last super badass are all that stands in the way of total destruction.</description>

      <description>MS just released their sequel to Crimson Skies on the Xbox. Heh heh, they know its a good game and they want it to help drive purchases of the Xbox and subscriptions to Xbox Live. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to take some notes down about the original for some time because it was a game I enjoyed and I thought it worth reflecting on why I enjoyed it as much as I did.</description>

      <description>Just got back from dinner with some friends from my days at QuickStart, one of which is was Matthew Chamberlain of Microsoft. He reports that hes still on the hunt at MS on my behalf (which is, of course, awfully nice of him). We got together a couple weeks ago at the MS SF office to search for people to talk to. We decided it would be a good idea to start with a couple of guys at the top (it goes something like: guys at the top-&amp;gt;studio heads-&amp;gt;exec producers-&amp;gt;producers-&amp;gt;associate producers) and go from there.</description>

      <description>Its amazing what you can learn from reading the SEC filings for public companies. I thought Id check out EA&amp;rsquo;s filing in June and see what I could learn about the company. Its always a great way to see where the money really is and where the company is headed, generally speaking.
So far I&amp;rsquo;ve gleaned a few interesting tidbits:
 The new EALA is going to be pretty important. EA is consolidating the old LA, Irvine, and Vegas studios into it, at substantial expense.</description>

I was introduced to Matt through my friend Ben, who is friends with Matts roommate (3 degrees). Matt worked as a mid-level QA dude on the publishers side of The Sims a few years back and he told me that EA Redwood Shores is a great place to work.</description>

I never would have guessed he knew people in the industry, but hes introduced me to Joel and to RJ Berg, a producer over at LucasArts. It just goes to show that when you are looking to meet people in the industry, tell everyone you can. You never know who all your friends of friends know.</description>

      <description>What is the point of all this?
This site exists to encourage and educate future EA employees about the roles and people of EA.
When I started looking into the game industry I couldnt find much guidance about how to make the jump coming from 10 years in another industry. So, I decided I would share my experiences and try to blaze a path for the next person. Much of the blog was written while I was in the middle of figuring out how to find a job with EA.</description>

Development Director
The DDs report to Exec Producers who report to Tom Frisina. As I understand it, DDs at EAP represent the publishers (EA&amp;rsquo;s) interests on a project by helping guide the studio EA has a partnership with; ideally to help them take a successful game and turn it into a successful franchise.</description>

He pointed out that in December, after the big Christmas push in October, a lot of the teams are working on their pilots with a small team of artists and developers.</description>

      <description>My friend Auren Hoffman just sent me a copy of Games 411 out of the blue. Nice! I was planning on getting this. Turns out the publisher is Andrew Boer. He used to be the VP of Sales for BridgePath (a company I cofounded in 1997, acquired in 2002) before he left to get his MBA over at Harvard. I wonder how he came to be involved with this project</description>

      <description>I spent Wednesday at the GDC and I have to say it was excellent. I served on a panel discussing Quality of Life and a roundtable on the same subject. Unfortunately I did a crappy job of presenting on the panelword to the wise: public speaking is a real skill that needs to be maintained and practiced (and a good presentation requires good prep). The roundtable went well though and we talked about some really good stuff.</description>

      <description>A couple days ago Rob emailed me letting me know that he had pitched me to EA Partners and they were interested in speaking with me. :) As I understand it, EAP is looking for producer-types at an array of levels to help manage their relationships with outside studios, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing on one or a handful of projects at a time. Today I received an email from EA&amp;rsquo;s job engine with more details.</description>

So, you might expect it would be a buyers market for talent.</description>

      <description>Picked up a copy of HW2. You could say I opened the box with some anticipationthe first one remains one of my favorite games. It was immersive&amp;ndash;the story was engaging, the sound built and maintained the mood, and the interface still is the easiest 3D RTS I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. As for the sequel it has spawned, HW2 gives a great first impression&amp;ndash;the production quality is certainly there. The graphics, interface, and sound have all taken evolutionary steps that are great to see.</description>

Weve been asked to produce a white paper overviewing the state of the industry from a QoL point of view, to be unveiled at GDC 2004. The whole thing has been pretty illuminating.
I&amp;rsquo;m getting a health dose of reality from people who have come together to air the industrys dirty laundryall manner of things from unionization to reasons people leave the industry have come up.</description>

John Welch of Shockwave.com, Dave Rohrl of EA Online, Margaret Wallace of Skunk Studios, and Mark DeLoura of Sony formed the evenings panel with Jennifer Olsen (editor-in-chief of Game Developer Magazine) moderating.
I was very impressed by Dave, who I felt did an excellent job of presenting his perspective on online gaming and he was just a fun speaker.</description>

These were proceeded by two phone interviews a couple weeks ago. It was pretty cool meeting everyone and having the chance to ask a lot of questions about EA and the production roles here.
Craig Alexander told me the reason for the high number of interviews was that EA is very consensus oriented&amp;ndash;I will be working with a lot of people very closely under a lot of pressure and it&amp;rsquo;s important that everyone get along really well.</description>

[For internships at EA] I noticed that the applicant pool consists of about 720 students, and they only take in around 60. I had a question as to where most of these internship applications and opportunities fall . And also if 720 or so applicants consist of both high school students, current college students, and college grads.or just grads. Also, if you could tell me how many internships do they offer in the Marketing/PR department for the summer.</description>

So I walked into Tiburon, very cool building. I saw some arcade machines and stuff in this one room, it must have been the game room. I then found where I needed to go, told them I was there for the interview, and they gave me an application to fill out.</description>

We started our conversation with the standard questions about my interest in games, my favorites, etc. and then I started in with some questions of my own. I asked what makes the difference between a good producer and a great producer and he said there were three areas where a great producer excels:</description>

Does anyone have any information on IT jobs available in Orlando? I&amp;rsquo;m looking to work in the Orlando area. Is there certain certifications that I should get to be qualified or is the best way to start off, is to start at the bottom and work your way up?
Rob Replies:
Well, it varies depending on what department of IT you work for. Certifications and experience will definitely not hurt you.</description>

Hey Scott, You may have no way of gaining this info, but how effective has the web been for recruiting candidates at EA? Do you know of many people who have posted for positions via the web and have had success (success meaning interviews&amp;quot;)? Would it be better to go snail mail? Just curious as to your thoughts.
My Reply:
Most of the people I talk to got in through a friend, not through a web site.</description>

Alright, so, I&amp;rsquo;ll start off with a simple question&amp;ndash;how does one go about getting a job as a software engineer at EA? I hate to come off as arrogant, however, I have learned that this may be the only chance I have&amp;ndash;every person trying to get a job &amp;ldquo;fluffs up&amp;rdquo; their resume, advertising skills they dont really have. Thus, on a resume, I am the same as anyone else, because even though I may be honest about my skills, I look no different on a resume than someone whos fluffed theirs up.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re under 30 &amp;amp; probably not making a six-figure salary at EA, where do you live? Redwood City? I&amp;rsquo;m assuming most rent an apartment but what areas are safe and but have clubs, bars, shops, etc.?
My Reply:
I&amp;rsquo;m under the impression that the towns near Redwood City are not geared to single people under 30. The rent doesnt seem too bad$1200/mo for a 1 room apt or $700 for a room in a house.</description>

The Front Desk Puzzle &#39; 10 points
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, after about 4 visits, that when the front desk calls someone and tells me that they have confirmed that they know I&amp;rsquo;m in 250 it can actually mean one of a few different things: a) they left a message for someone other than the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, b) they left a message for the person I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to meet with, c) they talked to someone who doesnt know who I am, doesnt care, and is not coming down to see me, d) they talked to the right person and they are actually coming right down.</description>

      <description>Writing about RPGs has gotten me all misty eyed for my pen-and-paper days past. I though Id try and find a game of Mage in the Bay Area. Posted on Craigslist and the forums for Mage, but I havent turned up much. After looking at the limited level of Internet chatter related to the game these day, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think there arent that many people playing Mage. So sad. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to storytell a game myself, or perhaps consider other game worlds like Vampire or D&amp;amp;D.</description>

Wow, that would be excellent&amp;hellip;Id love to have a chance to work at Maxis (which is, btw, an EA company). I sent an email over to Kana Ryan whom I noticed was the exec producer on the SimCity series as of SimCity 4. Yah, shes probably not the hiring manager, but hopefully shell be nice enough to forward it to them&amp;hellip;I also sent an email to Toby asking if he might know who over there is the hiring manager so I can address my interest to the right person.</description>

What would you say would be a better route if I want to get into a production role? I could take a computer game design/programming class that will mostly focus on the implementation process or take classes that revolve around operations management and business classes.

From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen all of those skills are useful to a producer, though I think you would have easier time getting a job in todays industry with programming training than with business training.</description>

We dont perceive the world as a raw stream of color and brightness&amp;ndash;we see objects that retain their integrity even as we turn our heads or they move around. Anyone whos written AI visual navigation/targeting systems can attest to what an impressive ability this is.

      <description>I was recently asked how online networking tools like Spoke have contributed to my efforts to meet people within the game industry. I signed up for Spoke, Linked-In, Friendster, and couple others a few months ago. But none of them were much help for meeting people in the game industry.
Whats Missing?
First, I havent met many people in the game industry that choose to spend a lot of time on networking&amp;ndash;it sorta happens during the course of working in the industry but the industry is otherwise a bit insulated.</description>

      <description>Ken Writes:
EA has updated the job board on their website. I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my resume but when it shows up in the text box, a lot of my alignment is thrown off. Should I adjust it to fit the text box or leave it as it is in its MS-Word state? Which way will EA see it when I submit my resume?
Phil Replies:
Hi Kenbo, it might be easiest if you cut and paste your word document into Notepad and then format in that file.</description>

      <description>Just got off the phone with Mark Kirk of PDI-Dreamworks. Hes the former neighbor of my dads friend Phil (thats 3 degrees). Hes working on some really interesting stuff&amp;ndash;he started in IT (got introduced to the company by a friend who was getting his masters degree in graphics) and now builds the project and asset management/project pipeline tool for PDI. Basically, he makes it easier for everyone to do their piece on a film and seamlessly pass things to the next person for the work they need to do, all the while maintaining a great deal of transparency and insight into where things are on the project.</description>

      <description>Lisa and I spoke briefly a couple months ago, before scheduling todays informational interview. Lisa called right on time. She started by mentioning that this site has been an item over at Maxis and the blog entry that mentioned our first encounter had gotten her some attention. :) I hope it was good! I took the opportunity to let her know that I dont post anything that I suspect or am told is confidential, and I give my conversation partners the final say on material I put on here.</description>

      <description>My friend Auren emailed me an introduction to Tiffany Spencer who is a PR Manager (as best I can tellshe works out of SF and Ubisofts SF office is a marketing office) for Ubisoft. She emailed me once last week but I havent been able to reach her since. Perhaps shes out of town or very busy. I am reminded of how many times I have had to contact a person 10 times or more before I finally got a hold of them.</description>

      <description>A couple days ago I emailed Craig Alexander thanking him for the opportunity to interview with his team and asking for a time to talk and get his feedback on the interviews. While I wasnt a fit for somewhat structural reasons I figured there were probably other areas that could use some improvement. We connected this evening and Craig buried me with help and advice!
I started the conversation with a quick recap of what I was looking for: how I could have presented myself better and what I should do to be better prepared when I interview with other groups at EA.</description>

And of course, being a producer and all, Erin was in the office that day. :) Shes leading the charge on the next Bond game after all, and she was wrapping pre-beta. I was plunking away on the piano when she walked up and we went to grab lunch nearby.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll start adding them as I read them and then see about adding the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve already read, at least the ones I can remember&amp;hellip;there have been a lot.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t ya just hate the whole salary negotiation thing!? Lets say there was a &amp;lsquo;manager&amp;rsquo; position being filled by someone with eight years experience in the industry. What kind of salary would be reasonable with which to begin negotiations? I know theres a lot of considerations and probably a huge range; I&amp;rsquo;m just looking for a baseline to get me headed in the right direction.

Basically, it was really cool :) So I was looking forward to meeting Neil and seeing what it was we would talk about.

I was wandering the area that the geese had marked as their own (at least, I think the dropping saturate sidewalk must be a popular hangout for them) when Tara called and we converged on 250 to talk. Tara made sure to introduce me to everyone she could along the path from the front of the building to the cushy chairs, because shes just cool that way.</description>

      <description>I emailed RJ Berg after I finished Alice to tell him how much I liked the game. I also asked why Moby wasnt showing him on Alice in their DB and it turns out the person who put the data in originally missed him. So, I contacted Moby and got them to add his credit as the executive producer on the project. But he did a lot more than exec produce the game&amp;ndash;he wrote the script and the dialogue while directing the voice and music.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take down the forums. It seemed that most people prefer to email me their questions directly, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer the choice ones in the blog. Besides, there are a ton of forums like those at the IGDA and elsewhere that are more trafficked and probably better suited to ongoing conversations on the topic of getting into the industry because they have a lot more participants. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a bunch of the posts and reformatting them as posts so we get the added benefit of having all the content searchable through a single click.</description>

Nice forum, Scott. I have actually set up phpBB a few times for friends I host websites for. I am presently in the process of creating a forum interface in Flash.

I learned a lot and a number of people even offered their business cards and told me to call or email if I had more questions. Thank yous are definitely in order! I was thinking about sending emails, but I decided on personalize hand-written thank you cards. I think cards convey greater appreciation and courtesy because they take more effort.</description>

Having read most of the production articles at Gamasutra and much of Sloperama I realize that like most software and unlike Athena, games do not spring forth from your head fully formed. So a few weeks ago I started looking into just what it would take to build a game myself.

      <description>While I was visiting Jordan Maynard last week, I noticed an old EA advertisement framed on his desk. It was a sort of manifesto for EA that defined what EA was about and told why it mattered. Even though some people may think of EA as more business oriented than a lot of smaller game companies, I think the founders articulated a vision that still captures the underlying spirit of the company and the industry: yes, money keeps the ball rolling, but at the end of the day we are not just creating a way to have fun&amp;ndash;we are participating in a cultural and artistic conversation about ourselves and our world.</description>

Actually it&amp;rsquo;s the observations about what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work and why is the part most applicable to games&amp;ndash;there are a lot of ways to take the player out of the game just as there are ways to take the viewer out of a movie. Game designers have the added complication of satisfying the desires of the player without complete control over what happens.</description>

      <description>Last night I got the full tour of Maxis from Toby Roberts, a central leader in their IT operation. Met Toby through my friend Kat Sewell and we all went to grab dinner after. Man, what a cool place Maxis is! I cant even begin to describe the energetic atmosphere in those colorful halls. And I cant even begin to tell you all the cool shit they are working on because of the NDA I had to sign before entering.</description>

      <description>Maybe its just me, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired off all the comic book evil that we have in games these days. Whether youre playing KotOR or Fable youll notice that when you decide to veer to the dark side of the force its pretty obvious that what you are doing is evil . That is to say comic book evil&amp;ndash;no grays here, pretty much anyone on the planet would judge the evil action as such.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I heard from Fredrik Thylander (a game designer with Digital I&amp;rsquo;llusions) who had stumbled across this site and sent me an email just to say he likes the site and good luck. He also put a good word in for John Vifian and EAP&amp;ndash;good bunch of guys to work with. Today I heard from Sean Decker who, it turns out, is over in Sweden working with a team on the Battlefield series.</description>

      <description>So I got up at 6a this morning to take care of some stuff before flying down to LA. For one, I timed a bunch of eBay auctions poorly and I&amp;rsquo;m packing them now. It probably doesnt help that I stayed up late opening up Pass 2 in SSX3. I also sent some emails out to contacts at EALA. I dont know if the new studio has opened yet, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it hasnt.</description>

I have about three years experience in creating stochastic simulations and visualization systems for the US Army at WSMR. In addition I am currently the Executive Producer of a CG kids show for APTN. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in flying the coop here sometime in the next couple of years. What kind of chance do I have to get into an Executive Producer slot at EA. A great deal of my experience is in getting a team of modelers/animators/programmers to create specific simulation systems for the military.</description>

My name is Albert, and I first want to thank you on having a great website. It&amp;rsquo;s very helpful to those who are planning on joining EA and need some advice on what to expect and what is expect of you. I have several questions I need to ask. I would like to know if you have heard any information about EA expanding their office in Orlando, Fl. I am in the process of getting my BA in Computer Animation , and I hear that EA is building an academy at the University of Central Florida.</description>

      <description>Lisa Bell called me this afternoon with a quick update: shes been in touch with her counterpart at EARS: Rachel McIntyre. Rachel was out of town when I met with EAP, otherwise I would probably have met her then, though I keep hearing her name. Anyway, Lisa has also been in touch with a couple of her Canadian counterparts too; but everyone (outside of Maxis at the moment) is hella busy hiring, so she thinks they will take a couple days to get back to her.</description>

      <description>I started our call by updating Lisa on my conversation with Hunter Smith, and she let me know what she had found. Basically, she feels stuff has a good chance of coming together at EARS shortly and shes still waiting to hear back from the other studios. Weve decided we should touch base one more time this year and then follow up after the holidays.

I have a couple of questions. First I am attending a community college in pennsylvania for a generalized computer degree and I am also planning on getting my mcse certification. What I am wondering is how can I get into the industry now to gain experience, I heard that testing is an excellent way to get started but what kind of experience are they looking for in testers. I love video games and EA is always been a favorite of mine, if you could tell me anything I would appreciate it.</description>

      <description>I made it past my 1 month anniversary at EA and I thought it would be good to reflect a bit on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and what I&amp;rsquo;m up to. I continue to be wowed by the people I work with. I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by the best of the best and it&amp;rsquo;s at once exhilarating and humbling.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Production Intern on an unannounced title which is in the middle of pre-production (the design/early prototyping phase for those of us coming from biz software).</description>

      <description>EA Academy recently linked to this site and the email has been coming in a bit faster&amp;hellip;and its started me thinking about what direction to take the site next. I&amp;rsquo;m working on putting up some forums so more people can check out the questions and discussions that have been happening in email and blog comments up to this point. I bet there are some people who visit this site on occasion who know a lot more than I do about breaking into the industry and might be happy to help out as well!</description>

First off, excellent site. I commend you on your creativity and tenacity in achieving your goal. Great job. | I&amp;rsquo;m a screenwriter thats had moderate Hollywood success. Moderate being defined in that I&amp;rsquo;ve sold two scripts to Hollywood production companies but nothing made (yet). I also have a background in I.T. (all areas of project life cycle). | My question is, do you know if EA employs a staff of writers?</description>
