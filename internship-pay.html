<a href=https://ggr.com/tags/iwanttoworkatea.com.html>#IWantToWorkAtEA.com</a></div><p><strong>Chereya Writes:</strong></p><p><em>Hey Scott, This may be too personal but I thought Id try asking you anyhow since you&rsquo;re the only person I know who might share the answer. Please feel free to disregard&mldr; What is the basic pay rate for EA interns? What other benefits are interns offered that are comparable to benefits accorded to a permanent position? ie. housing, insurance, holidays off or sick days&mldr; If my hubby-to-be gets an internship position -crosses fingers- what would the intern-role be like for married father of an infant? Just curious and want to make plans for additional income if necessary</em></p><p><strong>My Reply:</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m not certain that my situation is typical since I was shoehorned into the internship program by someone who wanted to help give me a chance. My guess is that most interns make $15-$30k annualized, no benefits (no sick days, no health insurance&ndash;the standard temp full-time treatment). The internship program is really geared towards unattached, younger, less experienced people (like the kind that typically are just graduating). For my own part, I&rsquo;m subsidizing my internship from my savings. I see it as an investment (as does EA, I think) and I&rsquo;ve budgeted accordingly&ndash;I have my own health insurance, dental, etc. I think it would be tough to support a family while starting from scratch in this industry!</p><p><em>Updated on October 11th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to Chereya&rsquo;s email, I figure she doesn&rsquo;t want to keep hearing from people through this page nor be exposed to more spam.</p></div></body></html>
