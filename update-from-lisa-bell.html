Basically, she feels stuff has a good chance of coming together at EARS shortly and shes still waiting to hear back from the other studios. Weve decided we should touch base one more time this year and then follow up after the holidays.</p><p><em>Updated on October 9th, 2013</em></p><p>Removed the link to my conversation with Hunter, I don&rsquo;t know where that blog post went&mldr;</p></div></body></html>
