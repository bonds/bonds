As the games get bigger its more and more important to have people on the team who have been exposed to the industrys best-practices as well as the broad topics that a formal education offers.</p></li><li><p>Sign up for an internship with a company like EA and besides that, try to get a summer job testing games.</p></li><li><p>Read about the industry, play games with an eye for how they are designed, and generally learn everything you can about games. The <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20031203004739/http://www.igda.org/breakingin/>IGDA</a>, <a href=http://www.sloperama.com/advice.html>Sloperama</a>, and <a href=http://www.gamasutra.com/>Gamasutra</a> are some good places to start.</p></li><li><p>Network. Its a tired adage, but its true&ndash;your career will depend more on who you know that what you know. Get in the habit of building relationships with people, staying in touch, and being a connector.</p></li></ol><p><em>Updated on October 10th, 2013</em></p><p>Archive.org-ed the IGDA link.</p></div></body></html>
